<h2 class="main">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Philippine Islands are but imperfectly known.
Though my visit was a short one, I enjoyed many advantages, from
immediate and constant intercourse with the various authorities and the
most friendly reception by the natives of every class.</p>
<p>The information I sought was invariably communicated with courtesy
and readiness; and by this publication something will, I hope, be
contributed to the store of useful knowledge.</p>
<p>The mighty &ldquo;tide of tendency&rdquo; is giving more and more
importance to the Oriental world. Its resources, as they become better
known, will be more rapidly developed. They are promising fields, which
will encourage and reward adventure; inviting receptacles for the
superfluities of European wealth, activity, and intelligence, whose
streams will flow back <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e197" href=
"#xd21e197" name="xd21e197">vi</a>]</span>upon their sources with
ever-augmenting contributions. Commerce will complete the work in peace
and prosperity, which conquest began in perturbation and peril.
Whatever clouds may hang over portions of the globe, there is a
brighter dawning, a wider sunrise, over the whole; and the flights of
time, and the explorings of space, are alike helping the
&ldquo;infinite progression&rdquo; of good.</p>

<h2 class="super">A VISIT<br>
TO THE<br>
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.</h2>
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">MANILA AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Three hundred and forty years ago, the Portuguese
navigator Fernando de Magalh&atilde;es, more generally known by his
Spanish designation Magellanes, proposed to Carlos I. an expedition of
discovery in the Eastern seas. The conditions of the contract were
signed at Zaragoza, and, with a fleet of six vessels, the largest of
which was only 130 tons burden, and the whole number of the crews two
hundred and thirty-four men, Magalh&atilde;es passed the straits which
bear his name in November, 1520; in the middle of March of the
following year he discovered the Mariana Islands, and a few days
afterwards landed on the eastern coast of the island of Mindanao, where
he was well received by the native population. He afterwards visited
the island of Zebu, where, notwithstanding a menaced resistance from
more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>than two thousand armed men, he succeeded in
conciliating the king and his court, who were not only baptized into
the Catholic faith, but recognised the supreme sovereignty of the crown
of Spain, and took the oaths of subjection and vassalage. The king
being engaged in hostilities with his neighbours, Magalh&atilde;es took
part therein, and died in Mactan, on the 26th April, 1521, in
consequence of the wounds he received. This disaster was followed by
the murder of all the leading persons of the expedition, who, being
invited to a feast by their new ally, were treacherously assassinated.
Guillen de Porceleto alone escaped of the twenty-six guests who formed
the company. Three of the fleet had been lost before they reached the
Philippines; one only returned to Spain&mdash;the <i lang=
"es">Vitoria</i>&mdash;the first that had ever made the voyage round
the world, and the Spanish king conferred on her commander, Elcano, a
Biscayan, an escutcheon bearing a globe, with the inscription,
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Primus circumdedit me</span>.&rdquo; A second
expedition, also composed of six vessels and a trader, left Spain in
1524. The whole fleet miserably perished in storms and contests with
the Portuguese in the Moluccas, and the trader alone returned to the
Spanish possessions in New Spain.</p>
<p>About one hundred and twenty of the expedition landed in Tidore,
where they built themselves a fortress, and were relieved by a third
fleet sent by Hernan Cortes, in 1528, to prosecute the discoveries of
which Magalh&atilde;es had had the initiative. This third adventure was
as disastrous as those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3"
name="pb3">3</a>]</span>which had preceded it. It consisted of three
ships and one hundred and ten men, bearing large supplies and costly
presents. They took possession of the Marianas (Ladrone Islands) in the
name of the king of Spain, reached Mindanao and other of the southern
islands, failed twice in the attempt to reach New Spain, and finally
were all victims of the climate and of the hostility of the
Portuguese.</p>
<p>But the Spanish court determined to persevere, and the Viceroy
(Mendoza) of New Spain was ordered to prepare a fourth expedition,
which was to avoid the Molucca Islands, where so many misfortunes had
attended the Spaniards. The fleet consisted of three ships and two
traders, and the commander was Villalobos. He reached the Archipelago,
and gave to the islands the name of the Philippines, in honour of the
Prince of Asturias, afterwards Philip the Second. Contrary winds (in
spite of the royal prohibition) drove them into the Moluccas, where
they were ill received by the Portuguese, and ordered to return to
Spain. Villalobos died in Amboyna, where he was attended by the famous
missionary, St. Francisco Xavier. Death swept away many of the
Spaniards, and the few who remained were removed from the Moluccas in
Portuguese vessels.</p>
<p>A fifth expedition on a larger scale was ordered by Philip the
Second to &ldquo;conquer, pacify, and people&rdquo; the islands which
bore his name. They consisted of five ships and four hundred seamen and
soldiers, and sailed from La Natividad (Mexico) in 1564, under the
orders of Legaspi, who was nominated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4"
href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>Governor of the Philippines, with
ample powers. He reached Tandaya in February, 1565, proceeded to
Cabalian, where the heir of the native king aided his views. In Bojol,
he secured the aid and allegiance of the petty sovereigns of the
island, and afterwards fixed himself on the island of Zebu, which for
some time was the central seat of Spanish authority.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e663src" href="#xd21e663" name="xd21e663src">1</a></p>
<p>Manila was founded in 1581.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Illness and the despotism of the doctors, who ordered me to throw
off the cares of my colonial government and to undertake a sea voyage
of six or seven weeks&rsquo; duration, induced me to avail myself of
one of the many courtesies and kindnesses for which I am indebted to
the naval commander-in-chief, Sir Michael Seymour, and to accept his
friendly offer of a steamer to convey me whither I might desire. The
relations of China with the Eastern Spanish Archipelago are not
unimportant, and were likely to be extended in consequence of the
stipulations of Lord Elgin&rsquo;s Tientsin Treaty. Moreover, the
slowly advancing commercial liberalism of the Spaniards has opened
three additional ports to foreign trade, of which, till lately, Manila
had the monopoly. I decided, therefore, after calling at the capital in
order to obtain the facilities with which I doubted not the courtesy of
my friend Don Francisco Norzagaray, the Captain-General of the
Philippines, would favour me, to visit Zamboanga, Iloilo, and Sual. I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>had already experienced many attentions from him in
connection with the government of Hong Kong. It will be seen that my
anticipations were more than responded to by the Governor, and as I
enjoyed rare advantages in obtaining the information I sought, I feel
encouraged to record the impressions I received, and to give publicity
to those facts which I gathered together in the course of my inquiries,
assisted by such publications as have been accessible to me.</p>
<p>Sir Michael Seymour placed her Majesty&rsquo;s ship
<i>Magicienne</i> at my disposal. The selection was in all respects
admirable. Nothing that foresight could suggest or care provide was
wanting to my comfort, and I owe a great deal to Captain Vansittart,
whose urbanities and attentions were followed up by all his officers
and men. We left Hong Kong on the 29th of November, 1858. The China
seas are, perhaps, the most tempestuous in the world, and the voyage to
Manila is frequently a very disagreeable one. So it proved to us. The
wild cross waves, breaking upon the bows, tossed us about with great
violence; and damage to furniture, destruction of glass and
earthenware, and much personal inconvenience, were among the varieties
which accompanied us.</p>
<p>But on the fifth day we sighted the lighthouse at the entrance of
the magnificent harbour of Manila, and some hours&rsquo; steaming
brought us to an anchorage at about a mile distant from the city. There
began the attentions which were associated with the whole of our visit
to these beautiful regions. The <i>Magicienne</i> was visited by the
various authorities, and arrangements <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>were made for my landing and
conveyance to the palace of the Governor-General. Through the capital
runs a river (the Pasig), up which we rowed, till we reached, on the
left bank, a handsome flight of steps, near the fortifications and
close to the column which has been erected to the memory of Magellanes,
the discoverer of, or, at all events, the founder of Spanish authority
in, these islands. This illustrious name arrested our attention. The
memorial is not worthy of that great reputation. It is a somewhat rude
column of stone, crowned with a bronze armillary sphere, and decorated
midway with golden dolphins and anchors wreathed in laurels: it stands
upon a pedestal of marble, bearing the name of the honoured navigator,
and is surrounded by an iron railing. It was originally intended to be
erected in the island of Zebu, but, after a correspondence of several
years with the Court of Madrid, the present site was chosen by royal
authority in 1847. There was a very handsome display of cavalry and
infantry, and a fine band of music played &ldquo;God save the
Queen.&rdquo; Several carriages and four were in waiting to escort our
party to the government palace, where I was most cordially received by
the captain-general and the ladies of his family. A fine suite of
apartments had been prepared for my occupation, and servants, under the
orders of a major-domo, were ordered to attend to our requirements,
while one of the Governor&rsquo;s aides-de-camp was constantly at hand
to aid us.</p>
<p>Though the name of <i>Manila</i> is given to the capital of the
Philippine Islands, it is only the fort and garrison <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>occupied by
the authorities to which the designation was originally applied. Manila
is on the left bank of the river, while, on the right, the district of
Binondo is the site inhabited by almost all the merchants, and in which
their business is conducted and their warehouses built. The palace
fills one side of a public <i lang="es">plaza</i> in the fortress, the
cathedral another of the same locality, resembling the squares of
London, but with the advantage of having its centre adorned by the
glorious vegetation of the tropics, whose leaves present all varieties
of colour, from the brightest yellow to the deepest green, and whose
flowers are remarkable for their splendour and beauty. There is a
statue of Charles the Fourth in the centre of the garden.</p>
<p>The most populous and prosperous province of the Philippines takes
its name from the fortification<a class="noteref" id="xd21e699src"
href="#xd21e699" name="xd21e699src">2</a> of Manila; and the port of
Manila is among the best known and most frequented of the harbours of
the Eastern world. The capital is renowned for the splendour of its
religious processions; for the excellence of its cheroots, which, to
the east of the Cape of Good Hope, are generally preferred to the
cigars of the Havana; while the less honourable characteristics of the
people are known to be a universal love of gambling, which is exhibited
among the Indian races by a passion for cock-fighting, an amusement
made a productive source of revenue to the State. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>Artists
usually introduce a Philippine Indian with a game-cock under his arm,
to which he seems as much attached as a Bedouin Arab to his horse. It
is said that many a time an Indian has allowed his wife and children to
perish in the flames when his house has taken fire, but never was known
to fail in securing his favourite <i lang="es">gallo</i> from
danger.</p>
<p>On anchoring off the city, Captain Vansittart despatched one of his
lieutenants, accompanied by my private secretary, to the British
consulate, in order to announce our arrival, and to offer any
facilities for consular communication with the <i>Magicienne</i>. They
had some difficulty in discovering the consulate, which has no
flag-staff, nor flag, nor other designation. The Consul was gone to his
<i lang="fr">ferme mod&egrave;le</i>, where he principally passes his
time among outcast Indians, in an almost inaccessible place, at some
distance from Manila. The Vice-Consul said it was too hot for him to
come on board, though during a great part of the day we were receiving
the representatives of the highest authorities of Manila. The Consul
wrote (I am bound to do him this justice) that it would &ldquo;put him
out&rdquo; of his routine of habit and economy if he were expected to
f&ecirc;te and entertain with formality &ldquo;his Excellency the
Plenipotentiary and Governor of Hong Kong.&rdquo; I hastened to assure
the Consul that my presence should cause him no expense, but that the
absence of anything which becomingly represented consular authority on
the arrival of one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s large ships of war could
hardly be passed unnoticed by the commander of that vessel.

<p>Crowds of visitors honoured our arrival; among them the archbishop
and the principal ecclesiastical dignitaries; deputations from the
civilians, army and navy, and the various heads of departments, who
invited us to visit their establishments, exhibited in their personal
attentions the characteristics of ancient Castilian courtesy. A report
had spread among the officers that I was a veteran warrior who had
served in the Peninsular campaign, and helped to liberate Spain from
the yoke of the French invaders. I had to explain that, though witness
to many of the events of that exciting time, and in that romantic land,
I was a peaceful spectator, and not a busy actor there. The bay of
Manila, one of the finest in the world, and the river Pasig which flows
into it, were, no doubt, the great recommendations of the position
chosen for the capital of the Philippines. During the four months of
March, April, May, and June, the heat and dust are very oppressive, and
the mosquitos a fearful annoyance. To these months succeed heavy rains,
but on the whole the climate is good, and the general mortality not
great. The average temperature through the year is 81&deg; 97&prime;
Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The quarantine station is at Cavite, a town of considerable
importance on the southern side of the harbour. It has a large
manufacturing establishment of cigars, and gives its name to the
surrounding province, which has about 57,000 inhabitants, among whom
are about 7,000 <i>mestizos</i> (mixed race). From its adjacency to the
capital, the numerical proportion of persons paying tribute is larger
than in any other province. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=

<p>The city, which is surrounded by ramparts, consists of seventeen
streets, spacious and crossing at right angles. As there is little
business in this part of the capital (the trade being carried on on the
other side of the river), few people are seen in the streets, and the
general character of the place is dull and monotonous, and forms a
remarkable contrast to the activity and crowding of the commercial
quarters. The cathedral, begun in 1654, and completed in 1672, is 240
feet in length and 60 in breadth. It boasts of its fourteen bells,
which have little repose; and of the carvings of the fifty-two seats
which are set apart for the aristocracy. The archiepiscopal palace,
though sufficiently large, did not appear to me to have any
architectural beauty. The apartments are furnished with simplicity, and
though the archbishop is privileged, like the governor, to appear in
some state, it was only on the occasion of religious ceremonies that I
observed anything like display. His reception of me was that of a
courteous old gentleman. He was dressed with great simplicity, and our
conversation was confined to inquiries connected with ecclesiastical
administration. He had been a barefooted Augustin friar (Recoleto), and
was raised to the archiepiscopal dignity in 1846.</p>
<p>The palacio in which I was so kindly accommodated was originally
built by an opulent but unfortunate <i lang=
"fr">prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of one of the captains-general; it was
reconstructed in 1690 by Governor Gongora. It fills a considerable
space, and on the south-west side has a beautiful view of the bay and
the surrounding headlands. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>There is a handsome Hall of Audience,
and many of the departments of the government have their principal
offices within its walls. The <i>patio</i> forms a pretty garden, and
is crowded with tropical plants. It has two principal stone staircases,
one leading to the private apartments, and the other to the public
offices. Like all the houses at Manila, it has for windows sliding
frames fitted with <i>concha</i>, or plates of semi-transparent
oysters, which admit an imperfect light, but are impervious to the
sunbeams. I do not recollect to have seen any glass windows in the
Philippines. Many of the apartments are large and well furnished, but
not, as often in England, over-crowded with superfluities. The courtesy
of the Governor provided every day at his table seats for two officers
of the <i>Magicienne</i> at dinner, after retiring from which there was
a <i>tertulia</i>, or evening reception, where the notabilities of the
capital afforded me many opportunities for enjoying that agreeable and
lively conversation in which Spanish ladies excel. A few mestizos are
among the visitors. Nothing, however, is seen but the Parisian costume;
no vestiges of the recollections of my youth&mdash;the <i lang=
"es">velo</i>, the <i lang="es">saya</i>, and the <i lang=
"es">basqui&ntilde;a</i>; nor the tortoiseshell combs, high towering
over the beautiful black <i lang="es">cabellera</i>; the fan alone
remains, then, as now, the dexterously displayed weapon of womanhood.
After a few complimentary salutations, most of the gentlemen gather
round the card-tables.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">Calzada</i>, a broad road a little beyond the walls
of the fortress, is to Manila what Hyde Park is to London, the Champs
Elys&eacute;es to Paris, and the Meidan <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>to Calcutta. It is the
gathering place of the opulent classes, and from five o&rsquo;clock
<span class="sc">P.M.</span> to the nightfall is crowded with
carriages, equestrians and pedestrians, whose mutual salutations seem
principally to occupy their attention: the taking off hats and the
responses to greetings and recognitions are sufficiently wearisome.
Twice a week a band of music plays on a raised way near the extremity
of the <i>patio</i>. Soon after sunset there is a sudden and general
stoppage. Every one uncovers his head; it is the time of the <i lang=
"es">oracion</i> announced by the church bells: universal silence
prevails for a few minutes, after which the promenades are resumed.
There is a good deal of solemnity in the instant and accordant
suspension of all locomotion, and it reminded me of the prostration of
the Mussulmans when the voice of the Muezzim calls, &ldquo;To prayer,
to prayer.&rdquo; A fine evening walk which is found on the esplanade
of the fortifications, is only frequented on Sundays. It has an
extensive view of the harbour and the river, and its freedom from the
dust and dirt of the Calzada gives it an additional recommendation; but
fashion despotically decides all such matters, and the crowds will
assemble where everybody expects to meet with everybody. In visiting
the fine scenery of the rivers, roads, and villages in the
neighbourhood of Manila, we seldom met with a carriage, or a traveller
seeking to enjoy these beauties. And in a harbour so magnificent as
that of Manila one would expect to see skiffs and pleasure-boats
without number, and yachts and other craft ministering to the enjoyment
and adding to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14"
name="pb14">14</a>]</span>variety of life; but there are none. Nobody
seems to like sporting with the elements. There are no yacht regattas
on the sea, as there are no horseraces on the shore. I have heard the
life of Manila called intolerably monotonous; in my short stay it
appeared to me full of interest and animation, but I was perhaps
privileged. The city is certainly not lively, and the Spaniard is
generally grave, but he is warm-hearted and hospitable, and must not be
studied at a distance, nor condemned with precipitancy. He is, no
doubt, susceptible and <i lang="es">pundonoroso</i>, but is rich in
noble qualities. Confined as is the population of Manila within the
fortification walls, the neighbouring country is full of attractions.
To me the villages, the beautiful tropical vegetation, the banks of the
rivers, and the streams adorned with scenery so picturesque and
pleasing, were more inviting than the gaiety of the public parade.
Every day afforded some variety, and most of the pueblos have their
characteristic distinctions. Malate is filled with public offices, and
women employed in ornamenting slippers with gold and silver embroidery.
Santa Ana is a favourite <i lang="es">Villagiatura</i> for the
merchants and opulent inhabitants. Near Paco is the cemetery,
&ldquo;where dwell the multitude,&rdquo; in which are interred the
remains of many of the once distinguished who have ceased to be.
Guadalupe is illustrious for its miraculous image, and Paco for that of
the Saviour. The Lake of Arroceros (as its name implies) is one of the
principal gathering places for boats loaded with rice; near it, too,
are large manufactories of paper <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>cigars. Sampaloc is the paradise
of washermen and washerwomen. La Ermita and other villages are
remarkable for their <i lang="es">bordadoras</i>, who produce those
exquisite pi&ntilde;a handkerchiefs for which such large sums are paid.
Pasay is renowned for its cultivation of the betel. Almost every house
has a garden with its bamboos, plantains and cocoa-nut trees, and some
with a greater variety of fruits. Nature has decorated them with
spontaneous flowers, which hang from the branches or the fences, or
creep up around the simple dwellings of the Indians. Edifices of
superior construction are generally the abodes of the mestizos, or of
the gobernadorcillos belonging to the different pueblos.</p>
<p>Philip the Third gave armorial bearings to the capital, and
conferred on it the title of the &ldquo;Very Noble City of
Manila&rdquo; (<i lang="es">La mui noble Ciudad</i>), and attached the
dignity of Excellency to the <i lang="es">Ayuntamiento</i>
(municipality).</p>
<p>During my stay at Manila, every afternoon, at five or six
o&rsquo;clock, the Governor-General called for me in my apartments, and
escorted by cavalry lancers we were conveyed in a carriage and four to
different parts of the neighbourhood, the rides lasting from one to two
hours. We seldom took the same road, and thus visited not only nearly
all the villages in the vicinity, but passed through much beautiful
country in which the attention was constantly arrested by the groups of
graceful bamboos, the tall cocoa-nut trees, the large-leafed plantains,
the sugar-cane, the papaya, the green paddy fields (in which many
people were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>fishing&mdash;and who knows, when the fields are
dry, what becomes of the fish, for they never fail to appear again when
irrigation has taken place?), and that wonderful variety and
magnificence of tropical vegetation,&mdash;leaves and flowers so rich
and gorgeous, on which one is never tired to gaze. Much of the river
scenery is such as a Claude would revel in, and high indeed would be
the artist&rsquo;s merit who could give perpetuity to such colouring.
And then the sunset skies&mdash;such as are never seen in temperate
zones,&mdash;so grand, so glowing, and at times so awful! Almost every
pueblo has some dwellings larger and better than the rest, occupied by
the native authorities or the mixed races (mostly, however, of Chinese
descent), who link the Indian to the European population. The first
floor of the house is generally raised from the ground and reached by a
ladder. Bamboos form the scaffolding, the floors, and principal
wood-work; the nipa palm makes the walls and covers the roof. A few
mats, a table, a rude chair or two, some pots and crockery, pictures of
saints, a lamp, and some trifling utensils, comprise the domestic
belongings, and while the children are crawling about the house or
garden, and the women engaged in household cares, the master will most
probably be seen with his game-cock under his arm, or meditating on the
prowess of the <i lang="es">gallo</i> while in attendance on the
<i lang="es">gallinas</i>.</p>

<p>The better class of houses in Manila are usually rectangular, having
a court in the centre, round which are shops, warehouses, stables and
other offices, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>families occupying the first floor. Towards
the street there is a corridor which communicates with the various
apartments, and generally a gallery in the interior looking into the
<i>patio</i> (court). The rooms have all sliding windows, whose small
panes admit the light of day through semi-transparent oyster-shells:
there are also Venetians, to help the ventilation and to exclude the
sun. The kitchen is generally separated from the dwelling. A large
cistern in the patio holds the water which is conveyed from the roofs
in the rainy season, and the platform of the cistern is generally
covered with jars of flowering plants or fruits. The first and only
floor is built on piles, as the fear of earthquakes prevents the
erection of elevated houses. The roofing is ordinarily of red
tiles.</p>
<p>The apartments, as suited to a tropical climate, are large, and many
European fashions have been introduced: the walls covered with painted
paper, many lamps hung from the ceiling, Chinese screens, porcelain
jars with natural or artificial flowers, mirrors, tables, sofas,
chairs, such as are seen in European capitals; but the large rooms have
not the appearance of being crowded with superfluous furniture. Carpets
are rare&mdash;fire-places rarer.</p>
<p>Among Europeans the habits of European life are slightly modified by
the climate; but it appeared to me among the Spaniards there were more
of the characteristics of old Spain than would now be found in the
Peninsula itself. In my youth I often heard it said&mdash;and it was
said with truth&mdash;that neither Don <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>Quixote nor Gil Blas were
pictures of the past alone, but that they were faithful portraits of
the Spain which I saw around me. Spain had then assuredly not been
Europeanized; but fifty years&mdash;fifty years of increased and
increasing intercourse with the rest of the world&mdash;have blotted
out the ancient nationality, and European modes, usages and opinions,
have pervaded and permeated all the upper and middling classes of
Spanish society&mdash;nay, have descended deep and spread far among the
people, except those of the remote and rural districts. There is little
now to distinguish the aristocratical and high-bred Spaniard from his
equals in other lands. In the somewhat lower grades, however, and among
the whole body of clergy, the impress of the past is preserved with
little change. Strangers of foreign nations, principally English and
Americans, have brought with them conveniences and luxuries which have
been to some extent adopted by the opulent Spaniards of Manila; and the
honourable, hospitable and liberal spirit which is found among the
great merchants of the East, has given them &ldquo;name and fame&rdquo;
among Spanish colonists and native cultivators. Generally speaking, I
found a kind and generous urbanity prevailing,&mdash;friendly
intercourse where that intercourse had been sought,&mdash;the lines of
demarcation and separation between ranks and classes less marked and
impassable than in most Oriental countries. I have seen at the same
table Spaniard, mestizo and Indian&mdash;priest, civilian and soldier.
No doubt a common religion forms a common bond; but to him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>who has
observed the alienations and repulsions of <i>caste</i> in many parts
of the Eastern world&mdash;caste, the great social curse&mdash;the
blending and free intercourse of man with man in the Philippines is a
contrast well worth admiring. M. Mallat&rsquo;s enthusiasm is unbounded
in speaking of Manila. &ldquo;Enchanting city!&rdquo; he exclaims;
&ldquo;in thee are goodness, cordiality, a sweet, open, noble
hospitality,&mdash;the generosity which makes our neighbour&rsquo;s
house our own;&mdash;in thee the difference of fortune and hierarchy
disappears. Unknown to thee is etiquette. O Manila! a warm heart can
never forget thy inhabitants, whose memory will be eternal for those
who have known them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Mas&rsquo; description of the Manila mode of life is
this:&mdash;&ldquo;They rise early, and take chocolate and tea (which
is here called <i>cha</i>); breakfast composed of two or three dishes
and a dessert at ten; dinner at from two to three; <i lang=
"es">siesta</i> (sleep) till five to six; horses harnessed, and an
hour&rsquo;s ride to the <i lang="es">pasco</i>; returning from which,
tea, with bread and biscuits and sweets, sometimes homewards, sometimes
in visit to a neighbour; the evening passes as it may (cards
frequently); homewards for bed at 11 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>; the
bed a fine mat, with mosquito curtains drawn around; one narrow and one
long pillow, called an <i lang="es">abrazador</i> (embracer), which
serves as a resting-place for the arms or the legs. It is a Chinese and
a convenient appliance. No sheets&mdash;men sleep in their stockings,
shirts, and loose trousers (<i>pajamas</i>); the ladies in garments
something similar. They say &lsquo;people must <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>always
be ready to escape into the street in case of an
earthquake.&rsquo;&rdquo; I certainly know of an instance where a
European lady was awfully perplexed when summoned to a sudden flight in
the darkness, and felt that her toilette required adjustment before she
could hurry forth.</p>
<p>Many of the pueblos which form the suburbs of Manila are very
populous. Passing through Binondo we reach Tondo, which gives its name
to the district, and has 31,000 inhabitants. These pueblos have their
Indian gobernadorcillos. Their best houses are of European
construction, occupied by Spaniards or mestizos, but these form a small
proportion of the whole compared with the Indian <i>Cab&aacute;nas</i>.
Tondo is one of the principal sources for the supply of milk, butter,
and cheese to the capital; it has a small manufacturing industry of
silk and cotton tissues, but most of the women are engaged in the
manipulation of cigars in the great establishments of Binondo. Santa
Cruz has a population of about 11,000 inhabitants, many of them
merchants, and there are a great number of mechanics in the pueblo.
Near it is the burying-place of the Chinese, or, as they are called by
the Spaniards, the <i lang="es">Sangleyes infieles</i>.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz is a favourite name in the Philippines. There are in the
island of Luzon no less than four pueblos, each with a large
population, called Santa Cruz, and several besides in others of the
Philippines. It is the name of one of the islands, of several
headlands, and of various other localities, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>has been
carried by the Spaniards into every region where they have established
their dominion. So fond are they of the titles they find in their
Calendar, that in the Philippines there are no less than sixteen places
called St. John and twelve which bear the name of St. Joseph; Jesus,
Santa Maria, Santa Ana, Santa Caterina, Santa Barbara, and many other
saints, have given their titles to various localities, often
superseding the ancient Indian names. Santa Ana is a pretty village,
with about 5,500 souls. It is surrounded with cultivated lands, which,
being irrigated by fertilizing streams, are productive, and give their
wonted charm to the landscape&mdash;palms, mangoes, bamboos, sugar
plantations, and various fruit and forest trees on every side. The
district is principally devoted to agriculture. A few European houses,
with their pretty gardens, contrast well with the huts of the Indian.
Its climate has the reputation of salubrity.</p>
<p>There is a considerable demand for horses in the capital. The
importation of the larger races from Australia has not been successful.
They were less suited to the climate than the ponies which are now
almost universally employed. The Filipinos never give pure water to
their horses, but invariably mix it with <i lang="es">miel</i> (honey),
the saccharine matter of the <i lang="es">ca&ntilde;a dulce</i>, and I
was informed that no horse would drink water unless it was so
sweetened. This, of course, is the result of &ldquo;education.&rdquo;
The value of horses, as compared with their cost in the remoter
islands, is double or treble in the capital. In fact, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>nothing
more distinctly proves the disadvantages of imperfect communication
than the extraordinary difference of prices for the same articles in
various parts of the Archipelago, even in parts which trade with one
another. There have been examples of famine in a maritime district
while there has been a superfluity of food in adjacent islands. No
doubt the monsoons are a great impediment to regular intercourse, as
they cannot be mastered by ordinary shipping; but steam has come to our
aid, when commercial necessities demanded new powers and appliances,
and no regions are likely to benefit by it more than those of the
tropics.</p>
<p>The associations and recollections of my youth were revived in the
hospitable entertainment of my most excellent host and the courteous
and graceful ladies of his family. Nearly fifty years before I had been
well acquainted with the Spanish peninsula&mdash;in the time of its
sufferings for fidelity, and its struggles for freedom, and I found in
Manila some of the veterans of the past, to whom the &ldquo;<span lang=
"es">Guerra de Independencia</span>&rdquo; was of all topics the
dearest; and it was pleasant to compare the tablets of our various
memories, as to persons, places and events. Of the actors we had known
in those interesting scenes, scarcely any now remain&mdash;none,
perhaps, of those who occupied the highest position, and played the
most prominent parts; but their names still served as links to unite us
in sympathizing thoughts and feelings, and having had the advantage of
an early acquaintance with Spanish, all that I had forgotten
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>was again remembered, and I found myself nearly as
much at home as in former times when wandering among the mountains of
Biscay, dancing on the banks of the Guadalquivir, or turning over the
dusty tomes at Alcal&aacute; de Henares.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e995src" href="#xd21e995" name="xd21e995src">3</a></p>
<p>There was a village festival at Sampaloc (the Indian name for
tamarinds), to which we were invited. Bright illuminations adorned the
houses, triumphal arches the streets; everywhere music and gaiety and
bright faces. There were several balls at the houses of the more
opulent mestizos or Indians, and we joined the joyous assemblies. The
rooms were crowded with Indian youths and maidens. Parisian fashions
have not invaded these villages&mdash;there were no
crinolines&mdash;these are confined to the capital; but in their native
garments there was no small variety&mdash;the many-coloured gowns of
home manufacture&mdash;the richly embroidered kerchiefs of
pi&ntilde;a&mdash;earrings and necklaces, and other adornings; and then
a vivacity strongly contrasted with the characteristic indolence of the
Indian races. Tables were covered with refreshments&mdash;coffee, tea,
wines, fruits, cakes and sweetmeats; and there seemed just as much of
flirting and coquetry as ever marked the scenes of higher civilization.
To the Europeans great attentions were paid, and their presence was
deemed a great honour. Our young midshipmen were among the busiest and
liveliest of the throng, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>even made their way, without the aid
of language, to the good graces of the <i lang="es">Zagalas</i>.
Sampaloc, inhabited principally by Indians employed as washermen and
women, is sometimes called the <i lang="es">Pueblo de los
Lavanderos</i>. The festivities continued to the matinal hours.</p>

<p>In 1855 the Captain-General (Crespo) caused sundry statistical
returns to be published, which throw much light upon the social
condition of the Philippine Islands, and afford such valuable materials
for comparison with the official <i>data</i> of other countries, that I
shall extract from them various results which appear worthy of
attention.</p>
<p>The city of Manila contains 11 churches, with 3 convents, 363
private houses; and the other edifices, amounting in all to 88, consist
of public buildings and premises appropriated to various objects. Of
the private houses, 57 are occupied by their owners, and 189 are let to
private tenants, while 117 are rented for corporate or public purposes.
The population of the city in 1855 was 8,618 souls, as

<p>The statistical commissioners state these discrepancies to be
inexplicable; but attribute it in part to the stationary character of
the population of the city, and the many fluctuations which take place
in the commercial movements of Binondo. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>Binondo is really the most important and most opulent pueblo of the
Philippines, and is the real commercial capital: two-thirds of the
houses are substantially built of stone, brick and tiles, and about
one-third are Indian wooden houses covered with the nipa palm. The
place is full of business and activity. An average was lately taken of
the carriages daily passing the principal thoroughfares. Over the
<i lang="es">Puente Grande</i> (great bridge) their number was 1,256;
through the largest square, Plaza de S. Gabriel, 979; and through the
main street, 915. On the Calzada, which is the great promenade of the
capital, 499 carriages were counted&mdash;these represent the
aristocracy of Manila. There are eight public bridges, and a suspension
bridge has lately been constructed as a private speculation, on which a
fee is levied for all passengers.</p>
<p>Binondo has some tolerably good wharfage on the bank of the Pasig,
and is well supplied with warehouses for foreign commerce. That for the
reception of tobacco is very extensive, and the size of the edifice
where the state cigars are manufactured may be judged of from the fact
that nine thousand females are therein habitually employed.</p>
<p>The Puente Grande (which unites Manila with Binondo) was originally
built of wood upon foundations of masonry, with seven arches of
different sizes, at various distances. Two of the arches were destroyed
by the earthquake of 1824, since which period it has been repaired and
restored. It is 457 feet in length and 24 feet in width. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>views on all sides from the bridge are fine,
whether of the wharves, warehouses, and busy population on the right
bank of the river, or the fortifications, churches, convents, and
public walks on the left.</p>
<p>The population of Manila and its suburbs is about 150,000.</p>
<p>The tobacco manufactories of Manila, being the most remarkable of
the &ldquo;public shows,&rdquo; have been frequently described. The
chattering and bustling of the thousands of women, which the constantly
exerted authority of the female superintendents wholly failed to
control, would have been distracting enough from the manipulation of
the tobacco leaf, even had their tongues been tied, but their tongues
were not tied, and they filled the place with noise. This was strangely
contrasted with the absolute silence which prevailed in the rooms
solely occupied by men. Most of the girls, whose numbers fluctuate from
eight to ten thousand, are unmarried, and many seemed to be only ten or
eleven years old. Some of them inhabit pueblos at a considerable
distance from Manila, and form quite a procession either in proceeding
to or returning from their employment. As we passed through the
different apartments specimens were given us of the results of their
labours, and on leaving the establishment beautiful bouquets of flowers
were placed in our hands. We were accompanied throughout by the
superior officers of the administration, explaining to us all the
details with the most perfect Castilian <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>courtesy. Of the working
people I do not believe one in a hundred understood Spanish.</p>
<p>The river Pasig is the principal channel of communication with the
interior. It passes between the commercial districts and the fortress
of Manila. Its average breadth is about 350 feet, and it is navigable
for about ten miles, with various depths of from 3 to 25 feet. It is
crossed by three bridges, one of which is a suspension bridge. The
daily average movement of boats, barges, and rafts passing with cargo
under the principal bridge, was 277, escorted by 487 men and 121 women
(not including passengers). The whole number of vessels belonging to
the Philippines was, in 1852 (the last return I possess), 4,053,
representing 81,752 tons, and navigated by 30,485 seamen. Of these,
1,532 vessels, of 74,148 tons, having 17,133 seamen, belong to the
province of Manila alone, representing three-eighths of the ships,
seven-eighths of the tonnage, and seventeen-thirtieths of the
mercantile marine. The value of the coasting trade in 1852 is stated to
have been about four and a-half millions of dollars, half this value
being in abac&aacute; (Manila hemp), sugar and rice being the next
articles in importance. The province of Albay, the most southern of
Luzon, is represented by the largest money value, being about
one-fourth of the whole. On an average of five years, from 1850 to
1854, the coasting trade is stated to have been of the value of
4,156,459 dollars, but the returns are very imperfect, and do not
include all the provinces. The statistical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>commission reports that on an examination of all
the documents and facts accessible to them, in 1855, the coasting trade
might be fairly estimated at 7,200,459 dollars.</p>
<p>At a distance of about three miles from Binondo, on the right bank
of the Pasig, is the country house of the captain-general, where he is
accustomed to pass some weeks of the most oppressive season of the
year: it has a nice garden, a convenient moveable bath, which is
lowered into the river, an aviary, and a small collection of
quadrupeds, among which I made acquaintance with a chimpanzee, who,
soon after, died of a pulmonary complaint. <span class=

<p>Having arranged for a visit to the Laguna and the surrounding hills,
whose beautiful scenery has given to the island of Luzon a
widely-spread celebrity, we started accompanied by the Alcalde Mayor,
De la Herran, Colonel Trasierra, an aide-de-camp of the Governor,
appointed to be my special guide and guardian, my kind friend and
gentlemanly companion Captain Vansittart, and some other gentlemen. The
inhabitants of the Laguna are called by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>Indians
of Manila <i lang="es">Tagasila&ntilde;gan</i>, or Orientals. As we
reached the various villages, the <i lang="es">Principalia</i>, or
native authorities, came out to meet us, and musical bands escorted us
into and out of all the pueblos. We found the Indian villages decorated
with coloured flags and embroidered kerchiefs, and the firing of guns
announced our arrival. The roads were prettily decorated with bamboos
and flowers, and everything proclaimed a hearty, however simple
welcome. The thick and many-tinted foliage of the mango&mdash;the tall
bamboos shaking their feathery heads aloft&mdash;the cocoa-nut loftier
still&mdash;the areca and the nipa palms&mdash;the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e1269" title="Source: plaintains">plantains</span>, whose huge
green leaves give such richness to a tropical landscape&mdash;the
bread-fruit, the papaya, and the bright-coloured wild-flowers, which
stray at will over banks and branches&mdash;the river every now and
then visible, with its canoes and cottages, and Indian men, women, and
children scattered along its banks. Over an excellent road, we passed
through Santa Ana to Taguig, where a bamboo bridge had been somewhat
precipitately erected to facilitate our passage over the stream: the
first carriage got over in safety; with the second the bridge broke
down, and some delay was experienced in repairing the disaster, and
enabling the other carriages to come forward. Taguig is a pretty
village, with thermal baths, and about 4,000 inhabitants; its fish is
said to be particularly fine. Near it is Pateros, which no doubt takes
its name from the enormous quantity of artificially hatched ducks
(<i lang="es">patos</i>) which are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>bred there, and which are seen
in incredible numbers on the banks of the river. They are fed by small
shell-fish found abundantly in the neighbouring lake, and which are
brought in boats to the <i lang="es">paterias</i> on the banks of the
Pasig. This duck-raising is called <i lang="tl">Itig</i> by the
Indians. Each pateria is separated from its neighbour by a bamboo
enclosure on the river, and at sunset the ducks withdraw from the water
to adjacent buildings, where they deposit their eggs during the night,
and in the morning return in long procession to the river. The eggs
being collected are placed in large receptacles containing warm paddy
husks, which are kept at the same temperature; the whole is covered
with cloth, and they are removed by their owners as fast as they are
hatched. We saw hundreds of the ducklings running about in shallow
bamboo baskets, waiting to be transferred to the banks of the river.
The friar at Pasig came out from his convent to receive us. It is a
populous pueblo, containing more than 22,000 souls. There is a school
for Indian women. It has stone quarries worked for consumption in
Manila, but the stone is soft and brittle. The neighbourhood is adorned
with gardens. Our host the friar had prepared for us in the convent a
collation, which was served with much neatness and attention, and with
cordial hospitality. Having reached the limits of his <i lang=
"es">alcadia</i>, the kind magistrate and his attendants left us, and
we entered a <i lang="es">falua</i> (felucca) provided for us by the
Intendente de Marina, with a goodly number of rowers, and furnished
with a carpet, cushions, curtains, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>and other comfortable
appliances. In this we started for the Laguna, heralded by a band of
musicians. The rowers stand erect, and at every stroke of the oar fling
themselves back upon their seats; they thus give a great impulse to the
boat; the exertion appears very laborious, yet their work was done with
admirable good-humour, and when they were drenched with rain there was
not a murmur. In the lake (which is called <i>Bay</i>) is an island,
between which and the main land is a deep and dangerous channel named
Quinabatasan, through which we passed. The stream rushes by with great
rapidity, and vessels are often lost in the passage. The banks are
covered with fine fruit trees, and the hills rise grandly on all sides.
Our destination was Santa Cruz, and long before we arrived a pilot boat
had been despatched in order to herald our coming. The sun had set, but
we perceived, as we approached, that the streets were illuminated, and
we heard the wonted Indian music in the distance. Reaching the river,
we were conducted to a gaily-lighted and decorated raft, which landed
us,&mdash;and a suite of carriages, in one of which was the Alcalde,
who had come from his <i>Cabacera</i>, or head quarters, to take charge
of us,&mdash;conducted the party to a handsome house belonging to an
opulent Indian, where we found, in the course of preparation, a very
handsome dinner or supper, and all the notables of the locality, the
priest, as a matter of course, among them, assembled to welcome the
strangers. We passed a theatre, which appeared hastily erected and
grotesquely adorned, where, as we were informed, it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>was
intended to exhibit an Indian play in the Tag&aacute;l language, for
our edification and amusement. I was too unwell to attend, but I heard
there was much talk on the stage (unintelligible, of course, to our
party), and brandishing of swords, and frowns and fierce fighting, and
genii hunting women into wild forests, and kings and queens gaily
dressed. The stage was open from the street to the multitude, of whom
many thousands were reported to be present, showing great interest and
excitement. I was told that some of the actors had been imported from
Manila. The hospitality of our host was super-abundant, and his table
crowded not only with native but with many European luxuries. He was
dressed as an Indian, and exhibited his wardrobe with some pride. He
himself served us at his own table, and looked and moved about as if he
were greatly honoured by the service. His name, which I gratefully
record, is Valentin Valenzuela, and his brother has reached the
distinction of being an ordained priest.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz has a population of about 10,000 souls. Many of its
inhabitants are said to be opulent. The church is handsome; the roads
in the neighbourhood broad and in good repair. There is much game in
the adjacent forests, but there is not much devotion to the chase.
Almost every variety of tropical produce grows in the vicinity. Wild
honey is collected by the natives of the interior, and stuffs of cotton
and abac&aacute; are woven for domestic use. The house to which we were
invited was well furnished, but with the usual adornings of
saints&rsquo; images and vessels for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>holy water. In the
evening the Tag&aacute;la ladies of the town and neighbourhood were
invited to a ball, and the day was closed with the accustomed
light-heartedness and festivity: the <i>bolero</i> and the <i>jota</i>
seemed the favourite attractions. Dance and music are the
Indians&rsquo; delight, and very many of the evenings we passed in the
Philippines were devoted to these enjoyments. Next morning the
carriages of the Alcalde, drawn by the pretty little ponies of Luzon,
conducted us to the <i lang="es">casa real</i> at Pagsanjan, the seat
of the government, or <i>Cabacera</i>, of the province, where we met
with the usual warm reception from our escort Se&ntilde;or Tafalla, the
Alcalde. Pagsanjan has about 5,000 inhabitants, being less populous
than Bi&ntilde;an and other pueblos in the province. Hospitality was
here, as everywhere, the order of the day and of the night, all the
more to be valued as there are no inns out of the capital, and no
places of reception for travellers; but he who is recommended to the
authorities and patronized by the friars will find nothing wanting for
his accommodation and comfort, and will rather be surprised at the
superfluities of good living than struck with the absence of anything
necessary. I have been sometimes amazed when the stores of the convent
furnished wines which had been kept from twenty to twenty-five years;
and to say that the cigars and chocolate provided by the good friars
would satisfy the most critical of critics, is only to do justice to
the gifts and the givers.</p>
<p>We made an excursion to the pretty village of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>Lumbang,
having, as customary, been escorted to the banks of the river, which
forms the limit of the pueblo, by the mounted principalia of Pagsanjan.
The current was strong, but a barge awaited us and conveyed us to the
front of the convent on the other side, where the principal
ecclesiastic, a friar, conducted us to the reception rooms. We walked
through the pueblo, whose inhabitants amount to 5,000 Indians,
occupying one long broad street, where many coloured handkerchiefs and
garments were hung out as flags from the windows, which were crowded
with spectators. We returned to the Cabacera, where we slept. Early in
the morning we took our departure from Pagsanjan.</p>

<p class="figureHead">VILLAGE OF MAJAJAY</p>
</div>
<p>We next advanced into the more elevated regions, growing more wild
and wonderful in their beauties. As we proceeded the roads became worse
and worse, and our horses had some difficulty in dragging the carriages
through the deep mud. We had often to ask for assistance from the
Indians to extricate us from the ruts, and they came to our aid with
patient and persevering cheerfulness. When the main road was absolutely
impassable, we deviated into the forest, and the Indians, with large
knives&mdash;their constant companions&mdash;chopped down the impeding
bushes and branches, and made for us a practicable way. After some
hours&rsquo; journey we arrived at Majayjay, and between files of
Indians, with their flags and music, were escorted to the convent,
whence the good Franciscan friar Maximo Rico came to meet us, and led
us up the wide staircase to the vast apartments above. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>The
pueblo has about 8,500 inhabitants; the climate is humid, and its
effects are seen in the magnificent vegetation which surrounds the
place. The church and convent are by far the most remarkable of its
edifices. Here we are surrounded by mountain scenery, and the forest
trees present beautiful and various pictures. In addition to leaves,
flowers and fruits of novel shapes and colours, the grotesque forms
which the trunks and branches of tropical trees assume, as if
encouraged to indulge in a thousand odd caprices, are among the
characteristics of these regions. The native population availed
themselves of the rude and rugged character of the region to offer a
long resistance to the Spaniards on their first invasion, and its
traditional means of defence were reported to be so great that the
treasures of Manila were ordered to be transported thither on the
landing of the English in 1762. Fortunately, say the Spanish
historians, the arrangement was not carried out, as the English had
taken their measures for the seizure of the spoils, and it was found
the locality could not have been defended against them.</p>
<p>We were now about to ascend the mountains, and were obliged to
abandon our carriages. Palanquins, in which we had to stretch ourselves
at full length, borne each by eight bearers, and relays of an equal
number, were provided for our accommodation. The Alcalde of the
adjacent province of Tayabas had come down to Majayjay to invite us
into his district, where, he said, the people were on the tiptoe of
expectation, had made arrangements for our reception, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>and
would be sadly disappointed if we failed to visit Lucban. We could not
resist the kind urgency of his representations, and deposited ourselves
in the palanquins, which had been got ready for us, and were indeed
well rewarded. The paths through the mountains are such as have been
made by the torrents, and are frequently almost impassable from the
masses of rock brought down by the rushing waters. Sometimes we had to
turn back from the selected road, and choose another less
impracticable. In some places the mud was so deep that our bearers were
immersed far above their knees, and nothing but long practice and the
assistance of their companions could have enabled them to extricate
themselves or us from so disagreeable a condition. But cheerfulness and
buoyancy of spirits, exclamations of encouragement, loud laughter, and
a general and brotherly co-operation surmounted every difficulty.
Around us all was solitude, all silence, but the hum of the bees and
the shrieks of the birds; deep ravines below, covered with forest
trees, which no axe of the woodman would ever disturb; heights above
still more difficult to explore, crowned with arboreous glories; brooks
and rivulets noisily descending to larger streams, and then making
their quiet way to the ocean receptacle. At last we reached a plain on
the top of a mountain, where two grandly adorned litters, with a great
number of bearers, were waiting, and we were welcomed by a gathering of
graceful young women, all on ponies, which they managed with admirable
agility. They were clad in the gayest dresses. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>The
Alcalde called them his <i>Amazonas</i>; and a pretty spokeswoman
informed us, in very pure Castilian, that they were come to escort us
to Lucban, which was about a league distant. The welcome was as novel
as it was unexpected. I observed the <i lang="es">Tag&aacute;las</i>
mounted indifferently on the off or near side of their horses.
Excellent equestrians were they; and they galloped and caracolled to
the right and the left, and flirted with their embellished whips. A
band of music headed us; and the Indian houses which we passed bore the
accustomed demonstrations of welcome. The roads had even a greater
number of decorations&mdash;arches of ornamented bamboos on both sides
of the way, and firing of guns announcing our approach. The Amazonas
wore bonnets adorned with ribands and flowers,&mdash;all had kerchiefs
of embroidered pi&ntilde;a on their shoulders, and variously coloured
skirts and gowns of native manufacture added to the picturesque effect.
So they gambolled along&mdash;before, behind, or at our sides where the
roads permitted it&mdash;and seemed quite at ease in all their
movements. The convent was, as usual, our destination; the presiding
friar&mdash;quite a man of the world&mdash;cordial, amusing, even witty
in his colloquies. He had most hospitably provided for our advent. All
the principal people were invited to dinner. Many a joke went round, to
which the friar contributed more than his share. Talking of the fair
(if Indian girls can be so called), Captain Vansittart said he had
thirty unmarried officers on board the <i>Magicienne</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=

<p>&ldquo;A bargain,&rdquo; exclaimed the friar; &ldquo;send them
hither,&mdash;I will find pretty wives for all of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must convert them first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! that is my part of the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will get the marriage fees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I forgot that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner, or supper, as it was called, the Amazonas who had
escorted us in the morning, accompanied by many more, were introduced;
the tables were cleared away; and when I left the hall for my bedroom,
the dancing was going on in full energy.</p>
<p>Newspapers and books were lying about the rooms of the convent. The
friar had more curiosity than most of his order: conversation with him
was not without interest and instruction.</p>
<p>We returned by a different road to Majayjay, for the purpose of
visiting a splendid waterfall, where the descent of the river is
reported to be 300 feet. We approached on a ledge of rock as near as we
could to the cataract, the roar of which was awful; but the quantity of
mist and steam, which soon soaked our garments, obscured the vision and
made it impossible for us to form any estimate of the depth of the
fall. It is surrounded by characteristic scenery&mdash;mountains and
woods&mdash;which we had no time to explore, and of which the natives
could give us only an imperfect account: they knew there were deer,
wild boars, buffaloes, and other game, but none had penetrated the
wilder regions. A traveller now and then had scrambled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>over the
rocks from the foot to the top of the waterfall</p>
<p>We returned to Majayjay again to be welcomed and entertained by our
hosts at the convent with the wonted hospitality; and taking leave of
our Alcalde, we proceeded to Santa Cruz, where, embarking in our
felucca, we coasted along the lake and landed at Calamba, a pueblo of
about 4,000 inhabitants; carriages were waiting to convey us to
Bi&ntilde;an, stopping a short time at Santa Rosa, where the Dominican
friars, who are the proprietors of large estates in the neighbourhood,
invited us as usual to their convent. We tarried there but a short
time. The roads are generally good on the borders of the Laguna, and we
reached Bi&ntilde;an before sunset, the Indians having in the main
street formed themselves in procession as we passed along. Flags,
branches of flowering forest trees, and other devices, were displayed.
First we passed between files of youths, then of maidens; and through a
triumphal arch we reached the handsome dwelling of a rich mestizo, whom
we found decorated with a Spanish order, which had been granted to his
father before him. He spoke English, having been educated at Calcutta,
and his house&mdash;a very large one&mdash;gave abundant evidence that
he had not studied in vain the arts of domestic civilization. The
furniture, the beds, the tables, the cookery, were all in good taste,
and the obvious sincerity of the kind reception added to its
agreeableness. Great crowds were gathered together in the square which
fronts the house of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>Don Jos&eacute; Alberto. Indians brought
their game-cocks to be admired, but we did not encourage the display of
their warlike virtues. There was much firing of guns, and a pyrotechnic
display when the sun had gone down, and a large fire balloon, bearing
the inscription, &ldquo;The people of Bi&ntilde;an to their illustrious
visitors,&rdquo; was successfully inflated, and soaring aloft, was lost
sight of in the distance, but was expected to tell the tale of our
arrival to the <i>Magicienne</i> in Manila Bay. Bi&ntilde;an is a place
of some importance. In it many rich mestizos and Indians dwell. It has
more than 10,000 inhabitants. Large estates there are possessed by the
Dominican friars, and the principal of them was among our earliest
visitors. There, as elsewhere, the principalia, having conducted us to
our head-quarters, came in a body to present their respects, the
gobernadorcillo, who usually speaks Spanish, being the organ of the
rest. Inquiries about the locality, thanks for the honours done us,
were the commonplaces of our intercourse, but the natives were always
pleased when &ldquo;the strangers from afar&rdquo; seemed to take an
interest in their concerns. Nowhere did we see any marks of poverty;
nowhere was there any crowding, or rudeness, or annoyance, in any
shape. Actors and spectators seemed equally pleased; in fact, our
presence only gave them another holiday, making but a small addition to
their regular and appointed festivals. Bi&ntilde;an is divided by a
river, and is about a mile from the Laguna. Its streets are of
considerable width, and the neighbouring roads excellent. Generally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>the houses have gardens attached to them; some on
a large scale. They are abundant in fruits of great variety. Rice is
largely cultivated, as the river with its confluents affords ample
means of irrigation. The lands are usually rented from the Dominicans,
and the large extent of some of the properties assists economical
cultivation. Until the lands are brought into productiveness, little
rent is demanded, and when they become productive the friars have the
reputation of being liberal landlords and allowing their tenants to
reap large profits. It is said they are satisfied with one-tenth of the
gross produce. A tenant is seldom disturbed in possession if his rent
be regularly paid. Much land is held by associations or companies known
by the title of <i>Casamahanes</i>. There is an active trade between
Bi&ntilde;an and Manila.</p>
<p>Greatly gratified with all we had seen, we again embarked and
crossed the Laguna to Pasig. Descending by that charming river, we
reached Manila in the afternoon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"

<h2 class="main">HISTORY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A few sketches of the personal history of some of the
captains-general of Manila will be an apt illustration of the general
character of the government, which, with some remarkable exceptions,
appears to have been of a mild and paternal character; while the
Indians exhibit, when not severely dealt with, much meekness and
docility, and a generally willing obedience. The subjugation of the
wild tribes of the interior has not made the progress which might have
been fairly looked for; but the military and naval forces at the
disposal of the captain-general have always been small when the extent
of his authority is considered. In fact, many conquests have had to be
abandoned from inadequacy of strength to maintain them. The
ecclesiastical influences, which have been established among the
idolatrous tribes, are weak when they come in contact with any of the
forms of Mahomedanism, as in the island of Mindanao, where the
fanaticism of Mussulman faith is quite as strong as that among the
Catholics themselves. Misunderstandings between the Church and State
could hardly be avoided where each has asserted a predominant power,
and such misunderstandings have often <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>led to the effusion of
blood and the dislocation of government. Mutual jealousies exist to the
present hour, and as the friars, in what they deem the interests of the
people, are sometimes hostile to the views of the civil authority, that
authority has frequently a right to complain of being thwarted, or
feebly aided, by the local clergy.</p>
<p>While shortly recording the names of the captains-general to whom
the government of the Philippines has been confided, I will select a
few episodes from the history of the islands, which will show the
character of the administration, and assist the better understanding of
the position of the people.</p>
<p>Miguel Lope de Legaspi, a Biscayan, upon whom the title of Conqueror
of the Philippines has been conferred, was the first governor, and was
nominated in 1565. He took possession of Manila in 1571, and died, it
is said, of disgust and disappointment the following year. The city was
invaded by Chinese pirates during the government of his successor Guido
de Lavezares, who repulsed them, and received high honours from his
sovereign, Philip II. Francisco de Saude founded in Camarines the city
of Nueva Caceres, to which he gave the name of the place of his birth.
He was a man of great ambition, who deposed one and enthroned another
sultan of Borneo, and modestly asked from the king of Spain authority
to conquer China, but was recommended to be less ambitious, and to keep
peace with surrounding nations. Rinquillo de Pe&ntilde;arosa rescued
Cagayan from a Japanese pirate, and founded New Segovia <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>and
Ar&eacute;valo in Panay; his nephew succeeded him, and in doing honour
to his memory set the Church of St. Augustin on fire; it spread to the
city, of which a large part was destroyed. In 1589, during the rule of
Santiago de Vera, the only two ships which carried on the trade with
New Spain were destroyed by a hurricane in the port of Cavite. The next
governor, Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as, sent to Japan the missionaries
who were afterwards put to death; he headed an expedition to Moluco,
but on leaving the port of Mariveles his galley was separated from the
rest of the fleet; the Chinese crew rose, murdered him, and fled in his
vessel to Cochin China. His son Luis followed him as governor. A
Franciscan friar, who had accompanied the unfortunate expedition of his
father, informed him that he would find, as he did, his patent of
appointment in a box which the Chinese had landed in the province of
Ilocos, and his title was in consequence recognised. Francisco Tello de
Guzman, who entered upon the government in 1596, was unfortunate in his
attempts to subdue the natives of Mindanao, as was one of his captains,
who had been sent to drive away the Dutch from Mariveles.</p>
<p>In the year 1603 three mandarins arrived in Manila from China. They
said that a Chinaman, whom they brought as a prisoner, had assured the
Emperor that the island of Cavite was of gold, that the Chinaman had
staked his life upon his veracity, and that they had come to learn the
truth of his story. They soon after left, having been conducted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>by the governor to examine Cavite for themselves.
A report speedily spread that an invasion of the Philippines by a
Chinese army of 100,000 was in contemplation, and a Chinese called Eng
Kang, who was supposed to be a great friend of the Europeans, was
charged with a portion of the defences. A number of Japanese, the
avowed enemies of the Chinese, were admitted to the confidence of the
governor, and communicated to the Chinese the information that the
government suspected a plot. A plot there was, and it was said the
Chinese determined on a rising, and a general massacre of the Spaniards
on the vespers of St. Francis&rsquo; day. A Philippine woman, who was
living with a Chinaman, denounced the project to the curate of Quiapo,
who advised the governor. A number of the conspirators were assembled
at a half-league&rsquo;s distance from Manila, and Eng Kang was sent
with some Spaniards to put down the movement. The attempt failed, and
Eng Kang was afterwards discovered to have been one of the principal
promoters of the insurrection. In the evening the Chinese attacked
Quiapo and Tondo, murdering many of the natives. They were met by a
body of 130 Spaniards, nearly all of whom perished, and their heads
were sent to Parian, which the insurgents captured, and besieged the
city of Manila from Dilao. The danger led to great exertions on the
part of the Spaniards, the ecclesiastics taking a very active part. The
Chinese endeavoured to scale the walls, but were repulsed. The monks
declared that St. Francis had appeared in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>person to encourage them.
The Chinese withdrew to their positions, but the Spaniards sallied out
from the citadel, burnt and destroyed Parian, and pursued the flying
Chinese to Cabuyao. New reinforcements arrived, and the flight of the
Chinese continued as far as the province of Batangas, where they were
again attacked and dispersed. It is said that of 24,000 revolted
Chinese only one hundred escaped, who were reserved for the galleys.
About 2,000 Chinese were left, who had not involved themselves in the
movement. Eng Kang was decapitated, and his head exposed in an iron
cage. It was three years after this insurrection that the Court of
Madrid had the first knowledge of its existence.</p>
<p>Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, after the suppression of this revolt,
conquered Ternate, and carried away the king, but died suddenly, in
1606, after governing four years. Cristobal Tellez, during his short
rule, destroyed a settlement of the Japanese in Dilao. Juan de Silva
brought with him, in 1609, reinforcements of European troops, and in
the seventh year of his government, made great preparations for
attacking the Dutch, but died after a short illness. In 1618, Alonzo
Fajardo came to the Philippines, with conciliatory orders as regarded
the natives, and was popular among them. He punished a revolt in Buhol,
sent an unsuccessful mission to Japan, and in a fit of jealousy killed
his wife. Suspecting her infidelity, he surprised her at night in a
house, where she had been accustomed to give rendezvous to her
paramour, and found her in a dress which left no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>doubt of
her crime. The governor called in a priest, commanded him to administer
the sacrament, and, spite of the prayers of the ecclesiastic, he put
her to death by a stab from his own dagger. This was in 1622.
Melancholy took possession of him, and he died in 1624. Two interim
governors followed. Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tabera arrived in 1626. He
brought with him 600 troops, drove the Dutch from their holds, and sent
Olaso, a soldier, celebrated for his deeds in Flanders, against the
Jolo Indians; but Olaso failed utterly, and returned to Manila upon his
discomfiture.</p>
<p>A strange event took place in 1630. The holy sacrament had been
stolen in a glass vase, from the cathedral. A general supplication
(<i lang="es">rogativa</i>) was ordered; the archbishop issued from his
palace barefooted, his head covered with ashes, and a rope round his
neck, wandering about to discover where the vase was concealed. All
attempts having failed, so heavy were the penitences, and so
intolerable the grief of the holy man, that he sank under the calamity,
and a fierce contest between the ecclesiastical and civil functionaries
was the consequence of his death.</p>
<p>In 1635 there was a large arrival of rich converted Japanese, who
fled from the fierce persecutions to which the Christians had been
subjected in Japan; but a great many Catholic missionaries hastened to
that country, in order to be honoured with the crown of martyrdom.
Another remarkable ecclesiastical quarrel took place at this time. A
commissary, lately arrived from Europe, ordered that all the friars
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>with beards should be charged with the missions to
China and Japan; and all the shorn friars should remain in the
Philippines. The archbishop opposed this, as the Pope&rsquo;s bulls had
no regulations about beards. Fierce debates were also excited by the
exercise of the right of asylum to criminals, having committed
offences, either against the military or the civil authority. The
archbishop excommunicated&mdash;the commandant of artillery rebelled.
The archbishop fined him&mdash;the vicar apostolic confirmed the
sentence. The Audiencia annulled the proceedings&mdash;the Bishop of
Camarines was called on as the arbiter, and absolved the commandant.
Appeals followed, and one of the parties was accused of slandering the
Most Holy Father. The Jesuits took part against the archbishop, who
called all the monks together, and they fined the Jesuits 4,000
dollars. The governor defended the Jesuits, and required the revocation
of the sentence in six hours. The quarrel did not end here: but there
was a final compromise, each party making some concessions to the
other.</p>
<p>The disasters which followed the insurrection of Eng Kang did not
prevent the influx of Chinese into the islands, and especially into the
province of Laguna, where another outbreak, in which it is said 30,000
Chinese took part, occurred in 1639. They divided themselves into
guerrillas, who devastated the country; but were subdued in the
following year, seven thousand having surrendered at discretion.
Spanish historians say that the hatred of the Indians to the Chinese
awaked them from their habitual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51"
href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>apathy, and that in the
destruction of the intruders they exhibited infinite zeal and
activity.</p>
<p>In the struggles between the natives and the Spaniards, even the
missionaries were not always safe, and the Spaniards were often
betrayed by those in whom they placed the greatest confidence. The
heavy exactions and gabelles inflicted on the Indians under Fajardo led
to a rising in Palopag, when the Jesuit curate was killed and the
convent and church sacked. The movement spread through several of the
islands, and many of the prisoners were delivered in Caraga to the
keeping of an Indian, called Dabao, who so well fulfilled his mission,
that when the governor came to the fortress, to claim the captives,
Dabao seized and beheaded his Excellency, and, with the aid of the
prisoners, destroyed most of the Spaniards in the neighbourhood,
including the priests; so that only six, among whom was an Augustine
barefooted friar, escaped, and fled to the capital. Reinforcements
having arrived from Manila, the Indians surrendered, being promised a
general pardon. &ldquo;The promise,&rdquo; says the Spanish historian,
&ldquo;was not kept; but the leaders of the insurrection were hanged,
and multitudes of the Indians sent to prison.&rdquo; The
governor-general &ldquo;did not approve of this violation of a promise
made in the king&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; but ordered the punishment of the
Spanish chiefs, and the release of such natives as remained in
prison.</p>
<p>In 1645, for two months there was a succession of fearful
earthquakes. In Cagayan a mountain was overturned, and a whole town
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1427" title=
"Source: engulphed">engulfed</span> at its foot. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>Torrents
of water and mud burst forth in many places. All the public buildings
in the capital were destroyed, except the convent and the church of the
Augustines, and that of the Jesuits. Six hundred persons were buried in
Manila under the ruins of their houses, and 3,000 altogether are said
to have lost their lives.</p>
<p>De Lara was distinguished for his religious sentiments. On his
arrival in 1653 he refused to land till the archbishop had preceded him
and consecrated the ground on which he was to tread. He celebrated a
jubilee under the authority of the Pope, by which the country was to be
purified from &ldquo;the crimes, censures, and excommunications&rdquo;
with which, for so many years, it had been afflicted. The archbishop,
from an elevated platform in Manila, blessed the islands and their
inhabitants in the presence of an immense concourse of people.
Reconciliations, confessions, restitutions followed these &ldquo;days
of sanctity;&rdquo; but the benedictions seem to have produced little
benefit, as they were followed by earthquakes, tempests, insurrections,
unpunished piracies, and, in the words of a Spanish writer, &ldquo;a
web of anxieties and calamities.&rdquo; Missionaries were sent to
convert the Mahomedans, but they were put to death, and many professed
converts turned traitors. Kung Sing, the piratical chief, who had
conquered Formosa, and who had 1,000 junks and 100,000 men under his
orders, had sent an envoy to Manila demanding the subjection of the
islands to his authority or threatening immediate invasion. The threat
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>created a general alarm: the Chinese were all
ordered to quit the country; they revolted, and almost all were
murdered. &ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; says De Mas, &ldquo;that any
Chinamen should have come to the Philippines after the repeated
slaughters&rdquo; of their countrymen at different periods, though it
is certain they have often brought down the thunderbolt on their own
heads. De Lara, having been accused of corruption, was fined 60,000
dollars, pardoned, and returned to Spain, where he became an
ecclesiastic, and died in Malaga, his native city.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;religiosity,&rdquo; to use a Spanish word, of De Lara was
followed by a very different temper in his successor, Salcedo, a
Belgian by birth, nominated in 1663. He quarrelled with the priests,
fined and condemned to banishment the archbishop, kept him standing
while waiting for an audience, insulted him when he had obtained it;
and on the death of the archbishop a few months afterwards, there were
royal <i lang="es">fiestas</i>, while the services <i lang="la">De
Profundis</i>, in honour of the dead, were prohibited as incompatible
with the civil festivities. The Inquisition interfered in the progress
of time, and its agents, assisted by an old woman servant, who held the
keys, entered the palace, found the Governor asleep, put irons upon
him, and carried him a prisoner to the Augustine convent. They next
shipped him off to be tried by the Holy Office in Mexico, but he died
on his way thither. The King of Spain cancelled and condemned the
proceedings, confiscated the property of those who had been concerned
in them, and directed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54"
name="pb54">54</a>]</span>all that had been seized belonging to Salcedo
to be restored to his heirs.</p>
<p>Manuel de Leon, in 1669, obtained great reputation among the
ecclesiastics. He governed for eight years and left all his property to
<i lang="es">obras pias</i>. His predecessor, Manuel de la Pe&ntilde;a
Bonifaz (nominated provisionally), had refused to surrender his
authority. He was declared an intruder, his goods were confiscated, and
his arrest was ordered, but he sought refuge in the convent of the
Recoletos, where he died. A quarrel took place between the competitors
for the provisional government&mdash;the one appointed enjoyed his
authority only for six months. He was, on his death, succeeded by his
competitor, who was displaced by Juan de Vargas Hurtado in 1678. Great
misunderstandings between the clergy and the civilians took place about
this time. The governor was excommunicated, having been ordered on
every holiday to appear in the cathedral and in the churches of Parcan
and Binondo, barefooted and with a rope round his neck. Refusing to
submit to such a degradation, he lived a solitary life, excluded from
all intercourse, on the banks of the river, until he obtained
permission to embark for New Spain; he died broken-hearted on the
voyage.</p>
<p>It must be remembered, in looking over the ancient records of the
Philippines, that the sole historians are the monks, and that their
applause or condemnation can hardly be deemed a disinterested or
equitable judgment. Hurtado is accused by them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>of many
acts of despotism: they say that, in order to accomplish his objects,
he menaced the friars with starvation, and by guards, prevented food
reaching the convents; that he interfered with the election of
ecclesiastics, persecuted and ordered the imprisonment of Bonifaz, his
immediate predecessor (provisionally appointed), who fled to a convent
of Recoletos (barefooted Augustines), and was protected by them. The
Jesuits denied his claim to protection, but during the controversy
Bonifaz died, and the records remain to exhibit another specimen of the
bitterness of the <i lang="la">odium theologicum</i> and of the unity
and harmony of which the Church of Rome sometimes boasts as the results
of her infallibility. The archbishop was at this time quarrelling with
the civil tribunals, to which he addressed his <i>mandamus</i>, and
answered their recalcitrancy by reminding them that <i>all</i> secular
authority was subordinate to ecclesiastical. The archbishop was placed
under arrest and ordered to be banished by the Audiencia. He was
conveyed by force in his pontifical robes to the vessel which
transported him to Pangasinan. The Dominicans, to whose order the
archbishop belonged, launched their excommunications and censures, and
troops were sent to the convent to prevent the ringing of bells and the
alarm and gathering of the people. The provincial, who had taken the
active part in resistance, was, with other friars, ordered to be
banished to Spain. When about to be removed, the dean commanded the
soldiers present to kiss the provincial&rsquo;s feet and do him all
honour while he poured out his benedictions on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>recalcitrant friars. In the midst of all this
confusion a new governor (Curuzcalegui) arrived, in 1684, who took part
with the clergy, and declared himself in favour of the banished
archbishop, and condemned his judges to banishment. One of them fled to
the Jesuit&rsquo;s College, a sanctuary, but was seized by the troops.
This by no means settled the quarrel, the following out of which is too
complicated and too uninteresting to invite further scrutiny here.</p>
<p>In 1687 the King of Spain sent out a commissioner to inquire into
the troubles that reigned in the Philippines. The Pope had taken up the
cause of the more violent of the clergy, and Pardo (the archbishop),
thus encouraged in his intemperance, declared the churches of the
Jesuits desecrated in which the bodies of the civilians had been
buried, who had adjudicated against the monks. Their remains were
disinterred, but most of the judges who had defended the rights of the
State against the ecclesiastical invasions were dead before the
commissioner arrived; and, happily for the public peace, the turbulent
prelate himself died in 1689. Curuzcalegui also died in 1689. After a
short provisional interregnum (during which Valenzuela, the Spanish
minister, who had been banished to the Philippines by Charles II., on
his return homeward, was killed by the kick of a horse in Mexico),
Fausto Cruzat y Gongora, was in 1690 invested with the government. His
rule is most remarkable for its financial prosperity. It lasted for
eleven years, for his successor, Domingo de Zubalburo, though nominated
in 1694, did not arrive till 1701. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>He improved the harbour, but was
dismissed by the King of Spain in consequence of his having admitted a
Papal Legate <i lang="fr">&agrave; latere</i> without requiring the
presentation of his credentials. The Audiencia demanded them, and the
Legate replied he was surprised at their venturing to question his
powers. He frightened the people by this assumption, and proceeded to
found a college in the name of St. Clement. The king was so exasperated
that he ordered the college to be demolished, fined the <i lang=
"es">Oidores</i> (judges) a thousand dollars, and removed the dean from
his office. Martin de Ursua y Arrimendi arrived in 1709, and died much
regretted in 1715; he checked the influx of the Chinese, and thus
conciliated popular prejudices. The interim governor, Jose Torralba,
was accused of peculation to the amount of 700,000 dollars. He was
called on by royal order to reimburse and find security for 40,000
dollars; but failing was sent to prison in fetters. He was ordered
afterwards to be sent to Spain, but agreed to pay 120,000 dollars. He
had not the money, and died a beggar. Fernando Bustillo (Bustamente)
landed in 1717. He spent large sums in useless embassies, and lived
ostentatiously and expensively. He set about financial reforms, and
imprisoned many persons indebted to the State. He seized some of the
principal inhabitants of the capital, menaced the judges, who fled to
the convents for protection. The governor took Torralba into favour,
releasing him from prison, and using him to undermine the authority of
the Audiencia, by investing him with its <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>powers. He ordered that
on the discharge of a piece of artillery, all the Spaniards should
repair to the palace: he arrested the archbishop, the chapter of the
cathedral, several prelates and ecclesiastics, when a tumult followed;
crowds rushed to the palace; they killed the governor and his son, who
had hurried thither to defend his father. Francisco de la Cuesta was
called upon to take charge of the government. The remaining children of
Bustillo were sent to Mexico, and the Audiencia made a report of what
had taken place to the king, who appointed Toribio Jos&eacute; Cosio y
Campo, and directed the punishment of those who had caused the former
governor&rsquo;s death; but under the influence of a Franciscan monk,
Cosio was induced to consent to various delays, so that nothing was
done in the matter, and the government in 1729 was transferred to
Fernando Valdes y Tamon, who reformed the military exercises, sent an
expedition to conquer the island of Palaos, failed in the attempt, and
was succeeded by a Fleming, Gaspar de la Torre, in 1739. He dealt so
severely with the fiscal Arroyo as to cause his death. He was disliked,
became morose and solitary, and died in 1745. The bishop elect of
Ilocos, father John Arrechedera, was the next governor, and the Sultan
of Jolo, who desired to be baptized, visited him in Manila. The
archbishop, to whom the matter was referred, declared that the Sultan
had been received into the bosom of the Church by the Dominican friars
of Panogui. The Marquis of Obando took possession of the government in
1750. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>The archbishop, whom he displaced, had received
orders from the Spanish Cabinet to expel the Chinese from the islands;
but whether from the honest conviction that the execution of the order
would be pernicious to the permanent interests of the
Philippines&mdash;in which judgment he was perfectly right&mdash;or (as
the natives avow) from an unwarrantable affection for the Chinese, he,
on various pretexts, delayed the publication of the royal mandate.
Obando involved himself in quarrels with the Mussulman inhabitants of
Mindanao, for which he had made no adequate preparation. He determined
to restore the Sultan of Jolo, but on reaching Zamboanga he proceeded
against the Sultan for unfaithfulness (<i lang="es">infidencia</i>),
sent him to Manila, and caused him to be put into prison. The
Mahomedans revolted. Obando desired to take the command against them.
The Audiencia objected to the exposure of the person of the governor.
The expedition failed, and disorders increased. He left the government
in a most unsatisfactory state, and died on his way homewards. Pedro
Manuel de Arandia assumed the government in 1754. He had some successes
against the Mahomedans (or Moors, as they are generally called by
Spanish writers). He intended to restore the Sultan of Jolo, but he
involved himself in quarrels with the clergy, and his proceedings were
disapproved by the Spanish Court. His unpopularity led to a fixed
melancholy, under whose influences he died in 1759. Though he left his
property for charitable purposes, the fact of its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>amounting to 250,000 dollars is urged as evidence
of the corrupt character of his administration. The Bishop of Zebu,
followed by the Archbishop of Manila, Manuel Royo, held the government
provisionally on the death of Arandia. It was Royo who surrendered
Manila, and transferred the island to the British in 1762.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1486src" href="#xd21e1486" name="xd21e1486src">1</a>
He was made a prisoner, and died <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>in prison in 1764, of grief and
shame it was said. Simon de Anda y Salazar, one of the judges of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>the Royal Audiencia, was charged with the
government during the possession of the capital by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>English,
and established his authority in Pampanga, where he maintained himself
till the arrival of Francisco de la Torre, who was provisionally
appointed by the Crown, and who, through Anda, received back Manila
from the British. Jos&eacute; Raon took possession of the government in
1766.</p>
<p>The Sultan of Jolo, replaced on his throne by the English, caused
great molestations to the island of Mindanao, against Raon, who was
unable to protect his countrymen. The expulsion of the Jesuits having
been determined on, the secret purpose was communicated to the
Governor. He was accused of having divulged, and of concealing a
writing-desk supposed to contain important documents. He was ordered to
be imprisoned in his own house, where he died.</p>
<p>One of the monkish historians gives the following account of the
manner in which the rebellious Indians were disposed
of:&mdash;&ldquo;Arza, with the efficacious aid of the Augustin
fathers, and of the faithful (who were many), went to Vigan, and
repeated what he had done in Cagallan; for he hanged more than a
hundred, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>and among them Do&ntilde;a Gabriela, the wife of
Silang, a mestiza of <i lang="es">malas ma&ntilde;as</i> (bad tricks),
not less valiant than her husband, the notary, and a great many
<i lang="es">cabecillas</i> (heads of groups of families), who fled to
the mountains of Alva; as to the rest of the rabble of this revolted
crew, he was satisfied with giving them each two hundred lashes, while
exposed on the pillory. He sent 3,000 Ilocos triumphant and rich with
booty to Pangasinan. This was in 1763.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1534src" href="#xd21e1534" name="xd21e1534src">2</a></p>
<p>After the capture of Manila by the British, they were naturally
suspected and accused of fomenting and encouraging the many
insurrections which followed that event. The impetuous and despotic
character of Anda, who assumed the governorship of the islands, had
made him many enemies, and he seems to have considered all opposition
to his arbitrary measures as evidence of treacherous confederation with
the English. No doubt their presence was welcomed, especially by the
Mussulman population of the southern islands, as affording them some
hopes of relief from Spanish oppression; but even the Philippine
historians do justice to the British authorities, and state that they
punished the piratical acts of their allies, without distinction of
persons. The Spaniards, however, encouraged Tenteng, a Mahomedan
<i>dato</i> (chieftain), to attack the British, whose garrison, in
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1542" title=
"Source: Batambangan">Balambangan</span>, was reduced by sickness from
400 men to seventy-five infantry and twenty-eight artillery. But it
was, says De Mas, &ldquo;solely in expectation of booty.&rdquo; From
the woods in the night <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>they stole down on the English while they
were asleep, set fire to the houses, and murdered all but six of the
garrison, who escaped in a boat with the English commandant; they then
hoisted the white flag, and did not spare the life of a single
Englishman left on shore. The Mahomedans seized much spoil in arms and
money. The Sultan of Jolo and the datos, fearing the vengeance of the
English, disclaimed all participation in the affair; but on
Tenteng&rsquo;s reaching Jolo, and delivering up his plunder to the
authorities, they, &ldquo;thinking there were now arms and money enough
to resist both Spaniards and English,&rdquo; declared Tenteng to be a
hero, and well deserving of his country. A few months afterwards, a
British ship of war appeared, and obtained such reparation as the case
allowed.</p>
<p>Anda had won so much credit for resisting the English, that he was
rewarded by his sovereign with many honours, made Councillor of
Castile, and returned as governor to Manila, in 1770. He imprisoned his
predecessor, many of the judges, the government secretary, a colonel,
and other persons. He sent some to Spain, and banished others from the
capital. He involved himself in ecclesiastical quarrels, met with many
vexations, and retired to the estate of the Recoleto friars, where he
died in 1766. De Mas says, in reference to this
period:&mdash;&ldquo;For more than two centuries, the Philippines had
been for the crown of Spain a hotbed of so many disputes, anxieties,
and expenses, that the abandonment of the colony was again and again
proposed by the ministers; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>but the Catholic monarchs could never
consent to the perdition of all the souls that had been conquered, and
which it was still hoped to conquer, in these regions.&rdquo; After a
short interregnum temporarily filled by Pedro Sarrio, Jos&eacute; Basco
arrived in 1778. He established the tobacco monopoly, sent off to
Europe three judges, and compelled other functionaries to quit the
capital, but, after two years&rsquo; occupation of the gubernatorial
seat, he returned to Spain, and obtained other employment from the
crown. Pedro Sarrio was again invested with the temporary authority.
Felix Berenguer de Marquina arrived in 1788, and ruled six years. He
was accused of corruption, but absolved by the king. Rafael Maria de
Aguilar was nominated in 1793.</p>
<p>In 1800 the governor-general having consulted the assessor on the
conduct to be observed towards the Mussulman pirates who had entered
the port of Manila, received a reply which is somewhat
grandiloquent:&mdash;&ldquo;It is time all the royal wishes should be
fulfilled, and that these islands cease to be tributaries to a vile and
despicable Mahomedan. Let him feel the direful visitations of a nation,
whose reputation has been so often offended and outraged, but which has
tolerated and concealed its wrongs the better to inflict its vengeance;
let the crown be cleansed from the tarnish, which in this port, and in
the sight of so many European nations, it has received from the low
rabble (<i>canalla</i>). The repeated disasters of the Indians appear
to have rendered Spaniards insensible; yet is there a man who, having
witnessed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>the desolation, murders, ruin of families, has not
his soul moved with a desire of revenge against the desolator and
destroyer? Were they our wives, sons, fathers, brothers, with what
clamour should we call on the authorities to punish the criminal, and
to restore our freedom.... Justice, pity, the obligation of <i>your</i>
consciences, upon which the royal conscience reposes, all plead
together.... Eternal memory for him who shall release us from the yoke
which has oppressed us for ages!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A treaty was concluded between the government of Manila and the
Sultan of Mindanao in 1805. The Sultan&rsquo;s minister of state was a
Mexican deserter; the ambassador of the Spaniards a Mexican convict. He
was, in truth, hardly dealt with, for, after making the treaty, he was
ordered to fulfil the term of his transportation.</p>
<p>In 1811, a conspiracy broke out in Ilocos, where a new god was
proclaimed by the Indians, under the name of Lungao. There was a
hierarchy of priests appointed in his honour. They made their first
attempts to convert the idolaters in Cagayan, and to engage them to
take part against the Spaniards. The Catholic missionaries were the
special object of their dislike, but the information which these
ecclesiastics gave to the authorities enabled them to suppress the
rebellion and to punish the leaders.</p>
<p>The cholera invaded Manila in 1819. A massacre of foreigners and
Chinese was the consequence, who were accused (especially the English)
of poisoning the wells. Robberies and other excesses followed the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>murders. The Host was paraded in vain through the
streets. The carnage ceased when no more victims were to be found, but
Spanish persons and property were respected.</p>
<p>Under the government of Martinez, in 1823, a rising took, place,
headed by Novales, a Manilaman in the Spanish service. As many as 800
of the troops joined the movement. They took possession of the palace,
murdered the king&rsquo;s lieutenant, and, according to all
appearances, would have overthrown the government, had there been any
organization or unity of purpose. But a few courageous men gathered
around them numbers faithful to the king and the royalist party.
Soldiers arrived; the insurgents faltered; the inconstant people began
to distrust the revolutionary leaders, and Novales was left with one
piece of artillery, and about 300 to 400 followers. Overpowered, he
fled, but was compelled to surrender. He was brought to a drumhead
court-martial, declared he had no accomplices, but was the sole seducer
of the troops, and was shot with one of his sergeants the same day.
Amnesty was proclaimed, after twenty non-commissioned officers had been
executed.</p>
<p>A serious insurrection broke out in Tayabas during the short rule of
Oraa (1841&ndash;43). The Spaniards say it was the work of a
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1574" title=
"Source: Tagal">Tag&aacute;l</span> called Apolinano, lay-brother of
the convent of Lucban, not twenty years old, who established a
brotherhood (<i>Cofradia</i>) exclusively confined to the native
Indians. The object does not seem to have been known, but the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>meetings of the Cofrades excited alarms and
suspicions. The archbishop called on the captain-general to put down
the assemblies, which in some places had sought legalization from the
authorities. The arrest of Apolinano was ordered, upon which he fled to
the mountains, where he was joined by 3,000 Indians, and it was
reported in Manila that he had raised the cry of rebellion in Igsavan.
On this the Alcalde mayor, accompanied by two Franciscan friars, a few
troops, and two small pieces of artillery, marched upon the denounced
rebels. They fired upon the Spaniards and killed the Alcalde. On the
news reaching the capital, a force of about 800 men was collected. It
is said the positions held by Apolinano were impregnable, but he had
not kept the promises he had made to the Indians, that sundry miracles
were to be wrought in their favour. Only a few advanced to meet the
Spaniards, and many of these were killed and the rest took to flight.
Almost without loss on their own side, the Spaniards left above 240
Indians dead on the field, and shot 200 whom they made prisoners.
Apolinano, in endeavouring to cross a river, was seized by two of his
own people, bound, and delivered over to the authorities. He was
accused of aspiring to be King of the Tag&aacute;los. He averred that
the objects of his Cofradia were purely and simply religious. He was
shot on the 4th of November, 1841. De Mas says he knew him, and that he
was a quiet, sober, unobtrusive young man, exhibiting nothing of the
hero or the adventurer. He performed menial services <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>at the
convent of Lucban; and as far as I can discover, the main ground of
suspicion was, that he admitted no Spaniards or Mestizos into his
religious fraternity; but that so many lives should have been
sacrificed to a mere suspicion is a sad story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Between 1806 and 1844 no less than fourteen governors followed one
another. Among them Narciso Claveria (1844&ndash;49) is entitled to
notice. He added the island of Balanguingui to the Spanish possessions.
One of his declarations obtained for him great applause&mdash;that
&ldquo;he had left Spain torn by civil dissensions, but that he should
make no distinctions between his countrymen on the ground of political
differences, but forget all title except that of <i lang=
"es">Espa&ntilde;ol y Caballero</i> (Spaniard and gentleman).&rdquo;
Since that time Ramon Montero has been their Governor <i lang="la">ad
interim</i>, viz., in 1853, 1854, and 1856. The Marquis of Novaliches
took possession of the government in 1854, but held it only for about
eight months. Don Manuel Crespo arrived in November, 1854, and the
present Governor-General, Don Fernando de Norzagaray, on the 9th of
March, 1857.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that during the period in which there have been
seventy-eight governors, there have been only twenty-two archbishops;
the average period of the civil holding being four years&mdash;that of
the ecclesiastical, eleven and a-half years. <span class=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1486" href="#xd21e1486src" name="xd21e1486">1</a></span> The
account given by Spanish writers of the taking of Manila by the British
forces, and here translated from Buzeta&rsquo;s narrative, seems given
with as much fairness as could be expected.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;In 1762, the city of Manila had reached to
wonderful prosperity. Its commercial relations extended to the
Moluccas, Borneo, many parts of India, Malacca, Siam, Cochin China,
China, Japan&mdash;in a word, to all places between the Isthmus of Suez
and Behring&rsquo;s Straits. But at the end of this year a disaster
visited the city which prostrated it for many years after. The English,
then at war with Spain, presented themselves with considerable forces.
The most illustrious Archbishop Don Manuel Royo, then temporarily in
charge of the government, had received no notice of any declaration of
war, and had made no preparations for defence. The enemy&rsquo;s fleet
was the bearer of the news. The garrison was composed of the regiment
<i lang="es">del rey</i>, which ought to have numbered 2,000 men, but
was reduced to 500, by detachments, desertion and disease. There were
only 80 artillerymen, all Indians, who knew little about the management
of guns. In this state of matters, the English fleet suddenly appeared
on the 22nd September, 1762. It consisted of thirteen ships, with 6,830
excellent troops. In total ignorance of public affairs, the fleet was
supposed to be one of Chinese <i>sampans</i>. Some defensive measures
were adopted, and an officer was sent to inquire of the commander of
the fleet what was his nation, and what the object of his unannounced
visit. The messenger returned the following day, accompanied by two
English officers, who stated that the conquest of the islands was the
purpose of the expedition. They were answered that the islands would
defend themselves. On the night of the 23rd/24th, the enemy effected
their disembarkation at the redoubt of St. Anthony Abbot. An attempt
was made to dislodge them; it failed. They were fired upon in the
morning of the 24th, but with little effect, so well were they
entrenched and protected by various buildings. In order to arrest their
proceedings, it was determined to make a vigorous sally, whose
arrangement was left to M. Fallu, a French officer in the service of
Spain; but this valiant soldier soon found that the foreign troops were
too numerous to be dealt with by his forces. He fought during the
night, and did not return to the citadel till 9 <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span> of the following day. There was a suspension of
hostilities, and the invaders sent a flag of truce to the city. The
bombardment continued on the 25th, and our grape-shot did much damage
to the enemy. On the 28th, in the morning, the English general asked
for the head of an officer who, having been the bearer of a flag of
truce two days before, had been decapitated by the Indians. He demanded
also the delivery of the persons who had committed the crime, and, if
refused, threatened horrible reprisals. The requirement was complied
with; and the Archbishop, who was exercising the functions of
government, and directing the defence of the city, showed himself on
horseback to the camp of the enemy, but without result. On the 29th,
the English squadron received a reinforcement of three ships, which
bore 350 Frenchmen from Pondicherry, who sought an opportunity to turn
upon the English, and nominated two of their confidants to arrange
their desertion and the accomplishment of their purpose; but the two
confederates were supposed by the Indians to be Englishmen, and,
instead of being welcomed, were slain. The English, being informed of
what had taken place, secured themselves against further treachery on
the part of the French. On the 3rd of October, a large force of
Pampangan Indians having arrived, a sally was resolved upon: it was
very bloody, but of no benefit for the defence. The following day the
besiegers made a breach in the Fundicion bulwarks. A council of war was
held, and the military decided that a capitulation was imperative: the
citizens were for continuing the defence. Unfortunately the Archbishop
was carried away from this opinion, which led to so many disasters for
Manila. On the 4th, there was a general conviction that this city would
soon be compelled to surrender; and the title of the Lieutenant to the
Government having been conferred on the judge (<i>oidor</i>) Simon de
Anda y Salazar, in order that he might transfer the seat of Spanish
authority to some other part of the island, and provide for its
defence, he left the same evening at 10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>,
in a launch with a few rowers, a Tag&aacute;l servant, 500 dollars in
silver, and forty sheets of official stamped paper. These were his
resources against an enemy having sixteen vessels in the bay, and who
were on the point of entering the city. Thus without an army or a
fleet, a man of more than threescore years reached Bulacan, determined
on pertinacious opposition to those conquerors who were about to enter
the capital. They did enter on the following day, leaving their
entrenchments and advancing in three columns to the breach, which was
scarcely practicable. Forty Frenchmen of Pondicherry led and found no
resistance. The fortress was compelled to surrender. The city was
sacked for forty hours, neither the churches nor the palace of the
Archbishop or Governor finding any mercy. The loss of the Spaniards
during the siege was three officers, two sergeants, fifty troops of the
line, and thirty civilians of the militia, without reckoning the
wounded; the Indians had 300 killed and 400 wounded. The besiegers lost
about 1,000 men, of whom 16 were officers. The fleet fired upon the
city more than 5,000 bombs, and more than 20,000 balls. It might have
been hoped that a sack of forty hours and the capitulation of the
garrison would have satisfied the enemy; it was not so, for during the
sackage the English commander informed the Archbishop that all the
inhabitants would be massacred if two millions of dollars were not
immediately paid in coin, and two millions more in drafts on the
Spanish treasury. To this it was necessary to accede, and the
charitable funds and the silver ornaments of the churches were devoted
to the payment.</p>
<p class="footnote">While the events of Manila had this tragic
termination, Anda collected in Bulacan the Alcalde, the ecclesiastics,
and other Spaniards, showed them his authority, which was recognised
with enthusiasm. On the evening of the same day news of the fall of
Manila was received, and Anda published a proclamation declaring
himself Governor and Captain-General of the Philippine Islands, and
chose for the seat of his government Bacalor in Pampanga. He thus for
fifteen months carried on the war, notwithstanding the insurrections
fomented by the English, especially among the Chinese, and
notwithstanding the general disorganization of the provinces. In fact,
he almost kept the English blockaded in Manila, from whose walls they
scarcely dared to venture. In Malenta, a property of the Augustin
friars, a French sergeant, named Bretagne, who deserted from the
English, and induced some thirty of his countrymen to follow his
example, was made captain, and directed operations against the
invaders, to whom he appears to have given much trouble by intercepting
provisions, and attacking stragglers from the city. The English offered
5,000 dollars for the delivery of Anda alive into their hands. But on
the 3rd July, 1763, a British frigate arrived announcing an armistice
between the belligerent powers, and directing the cessation of
hostilities. In March, 1764, news arrived of the treaty of peace; the
English evacuated Manila, and Spanish authority was re-established. The
mischief done by the English was repaired by Governor
Basco.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p>The generally accepted theory as to the formation of the Philippines
is, that they all formed part of a vast primitive continent, which was
broken up by some great convulsion of nature, and that these islands
are the scattered fragments of that continent. Buzeta supposes that
from Luzon the other islands were detached.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1607src" href="#xd21e1607" name="xd21e1607src">1</a></p>
<p>The Indians have a tradition that the earth was borne on the
shoulders of a giant, who, getting tired of his heavy burden, tumbled
it into the ocean, leaving nothing above the waters but the mountains,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>which became islands for the salvation of the
human race.</p>
<p>I do not propose to give a detailed geographical description of the
Philippine Islands. Buzeta&rsquo;s two octavo volumes will furnish the
most accurate particulars with which I am acquainted as to the various
localities. The facts which I collected in the course of my personal
observation refer specially to the islands of Luzon, Panay, and
Mindanao. The more general information has been derived from Spanish
authorities on the spot, or has been found in Spanish books which I
have consulted. I cannot presume to consider the present volume as
complete or exhaustive, but it will contribute something to augment
that knowledge which is already possessed.</p>
<p>The extent of the Philippine Archipelago is about 300 leagues from
north to south, and 180 leagues from east to west. The islands of which
it is composed are innumerable, most of the larger ones having some
Spanish or mestizo population. A range of irregular mountains runs
through the centre of the whole. Those known by the name of the
Caraballos, in Luzon, are occupied by unsubdued races of idolatrous
Indians, and extend for nearly sixty leagues. Several large rivers have
their sources in the Caraballos. At the top of Mount Cabunian, whose
ascent is very difficult, there is a tomb worshipped by the pagan
Igorrotes. There are large lakes in several of the islands, and during
the rainy season some of them become enormously extended. These
inundations are naturally favourable to the vegetable productions
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>by fertilizing vast tracts of land.
<i>Mindanao</i>, which means &ldquo;Men of the lake,&rdquo; has its
Indian name from the abundance of its inward waters, in the same way
that <i lang="es">La Laguna</i> has been adopted by the Spaniards as
the designation of the province bordering on the Lake of Bay. In this
latter district are many mineral and thermal springs, which have given
to one of its pueblos the name of Los Ba&ntilde;os (the baths). One of
them issues from the source at a temperature of 67&deg; of Reaumur.
They are much visited by the inhabitants of Manila. There are boiling
springs in the pueblo of Mainit.</p>
<p>The climate of the Philippines is little distinguished from that
which characterizes many other tropical regions of the East<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1639" title="Not in source">.</span> It is described in
a Spanish proverb as&mdash;</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Seis meses de polvo,</p>
<p class="line">Seis meses de lodo,</p>
<p class="line">Seis meses de todo.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Six months of dust, six months of mud, six
months of everything;&rdquo;&mdash;though it may generally be stated
that the rainy season lasts one half, and the dry season the other half
of the year. There are, however, as the distich says, many months of
uncertainty, in which humidity invades the ordinary time of drought,
and drought that of humidity. But from June to November the country is
inundated, the roads are for the most part impassable, and travelling
in the interior is difficult and disagreeable. Even in the month of
December, in several districts of Luzon, we found, as before mentioned,
places in which carriages are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=
"#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>necessarily abandoned, the palanquin
bearers being up to their thighs in mud; and other places in which we
were compelled to open a new way through the woods. The heat is too
oppressive to allow much active exertion in the middle of the day, and
the <i lang="es">siesta</i> is generally resorted to from 1 to 3
o&rsquo;clock <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, before and after which time
visits are paid and business transacted. The pleasant evening time is,
however, that of social enjoyment, and the principal people have their
<i>tertulias</i>, to which guests are welcomed from half-past 8
o&rsquo;clock to about 11 o&rsquo;clock <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span></p>
<p>The variations of the thermometer rarely exceed 10&deg; of Reaumur,
the maximum heat being from 28&deg; to 29&deg;, the minimum 18&deg; to
19&deg;. Winter garments are scarcely ever required.</p>
<p>The difference between the longest and shortest day is 1h. 47m. 12s.
On the 20th June, in Manila, the sun rises at 5h. 33m. 12s., and sets
at 6h. 26m. 48s.; on the 20th December, it rises at 6h. 26m. 48s., and
sets at 5h. 33m. 12s.</p>
<p>The minimum fall of rain in Manila is 84 inches, the maximum 114.
Hailstorms are rare. There is no mountain sufficiently high to be
&ldquo;snow-capped;&rdquo; the highest, Banaho, is between 6,000 and
7,000 feet above the level of the sea.</p>
<p>Like other tropical climates, the Philippines are visited by the
usual calamities gathered by the wild elements round that line which is
deemed the girdle of the world. Violent hurricanes produce fearful
devastations; typhoons cover the coasts with wrecks; inundations of
rivers and excessive rains destroy the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>earth&rsquo;s produce,
while long-continued droughts are equally fatal to the labours and the
hopes of husbandry. Earthquakes shake the land, overturn the strongest
edifices and sport destructively with the power of man; volcanic
mountains inundate the earth with their torrents of burning lava.
Clouds of locusts sometimes devour all that is green upon the surface
of the ground; and epidemic diseases carry away multitudes of the human
race. The ravages caused by accidental fires are often most calamitous,
as the greater part of the houses are constructed of inflammable
materials. When such a disaster occurs, it spreads with wonderful
rapidity, and, there being no adequate means of extinction, a whole
population is often rendered houseless.</p>
<p>During the change of the monsoons especially, the storms are often
terrific, accompanied by very violent rains, fierce lightning and loud
thunder. If in the night, the darkness thickens. Many lose their lives
by lightning strokes, and houses are frequently carried away by the
vehemence of the torrents.</p>
<p>Bagyo is the Indian name for hurricane. These violent outbreaks are
generally announced in the morning by a light smoky mist which appears
on the mountains; it gathers, and darkens, and thickens into heavy
clouds, and before day closes breaks out with its fearful and
destroying violence, raging from an hour and a half to two hours. M. de
Gentil says that in the torrid zone the clouds which bring the most
destructive tornadoes are at an elevation not exceeding 400 toises of
perpendicular height. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>The largest of the volcanoes is that of Mayon in Luzon. It is in the
shape of a sugar-loaf, perfectly conical. Its base covers several
leagues in the provinces of Albay and Camarines, and it is one of the
most prominent objects and landmarks visible from the sea; there is a
constant smoke, sometimes accompanied by flames; its subterranean
sounds are often heard at a distance of many leagues. The country in
the neighbourhood is covered with sand and stone, which on different
occasions have been vomited forth from the crater. There is a
description by the Alcalde of an eruption in 1767, which lasted ten
days, during which a cone of flame, whose base was about forty feet in
diameter, ascended, and a river of lava was poured out for two months,
120 feet in breadth. Great ruin was caused to the adjacent villages.
The lava torrent was followed about a month afterwards by enormous
outpourings of water, which either greatly widened the beds of the
existing rivers, or formed new channels in their rush towards the sea.
The town of Malinao was wholly destroyed, and a third part of that of
Casana. Many other villages suffered; forests were buried in sand;
which also overwhelmed houses and human beings. The ravages extended
over a space of six leagues.</p>
<p>From an eruption at Buhayan, sixty leagues from Zamboanga, in the
island of Mindanao, in 1640, large masses of stone were flung to a
distance of two leagues. The ashes fell in the Moluccas and in Borneo.
Dense darkness covered Zamboanga. Ships at sea lighted their lamps at 8
<span class="sc">A.M.</span>, but the light <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>could
not be seen through the clouds of sand. The mountain whence the
explosion originated disappeared, and a lake was formed and still
remains in the locality as a record of the agitation. The waters of the
lake were long white with ashes. The noise of the eruption was heard in
Manila.</p>
<p>About twenty leagues from Manila is the province of Batanga. In one
of the bays is an island called by the natives <i lang="tl">Binintiang
Malagui</i>, remarkable for its beauty, for the variety of its
vegetation, and the number of animals which inhabit it. The eastern
part of the island is a mountain, whose extinct volcano is seen in the
form of a truncated cone of enormous extent, surrounded by desolation.
The flanks of the mountain have been torn by vast channels, down which
the lava-streams must have flowed. The sides are covered with
ferruginous and sulphurous pyrites and scori&aelig;, which make the
ascent difficult. It is most accessible on the southern side, by which
we reach the mouth of the crater, whose circumference exceeds three
miles, and whose deep and wild recesses exhibit astounding evidences of
the throes and agitations which in former times must have shaken and
convulsed this portion of the earth. A Spanish writer says it looked
&ldquo;like an execrable blasphemy launched by Satan against
God.&rdquo; There are still some signs of its past history in the smoke
which rises from the abyss; but what characterizes the spot is the
contrast between the gigantic wrecks and ruins of nature on one side,
and the extreme loveliness and rich variety of other parts of the
landscape. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>Descending into the crater by the help of cords
round the body, a grand platform is reached at the depth of about 600
feet, in which are four smaller craters, one constantly and the others
occasionally emitting a white smoke, but they cannot be approached on
account of the softness and heat of the soil. To the east is a lake
from which a stream runs round the craters over beds of sulphur, which
assume the colour of emeralds. Formerly this lake was in a state of
boiling ebullition, but is now scarcely above the natural temperature;
it blackens silver immediately. Frequent earthquakes change the
character of the crater and its neighbourhood, and every new detailed
description differs from that which preceded it. The Indians have
magnificent notions of the mineral riches buried in the bosom of the
mountain, the sulphur mines of which were advantageously worked a few
years ago, when a well-known naturalist (Lopez, now dead) offered to
the Spanish government large sums for the monopoly of the right of
mining the district of Taal.</p>
<p>On the 21st of September, 1716, sounds like those of heavy artillery
proceeded from the Taal volcano, and the mountain seemed to be in a
state of ignition over a space of three leagues towards Macolot.
Gigantic towers of boiling water and ashes were thrown up, the earth
shook on all sides, the waters of the lake were agitated and overran
its banks: this lasted for three days. The water was blackened, and its
sulphurous smell infested the whole district. In 1754 a yet more
violent eruption, lasting eight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"
href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>days, took place, with terrible
explosions, heavings of the earth, darkness, and such clouds of dust
and ashes that all the roofs of the houses at Manila, at a distance of
twenty leagues, were covered. Great masses of stones, fire and smoke
were thrown from the mountain. The lake boiled in bubbles. Streams of
bitumen and sulphur ran over the district of Bong-bong. The alligators,
sharks, tunnies, and all the large fish, were destroyed in the river
and flung upon the banks, impregnating the air with stench. It is said
that subterranean and atmospheric thunders were heard at a distance of
300 leagues from the volcano, and that the winds carried the ashes to
incredible distances. In Panay there was midday darkness. Many pueblos
were wholly destroyed; among them Sala, Janavan, Lipa, and Taal: others
bearing the same names have been since founded at a greater distance
from the mountain.</p>
<p>Lopez gives a description of his descent into the crater. He
employed 100 men for eight days to make a slope for his going down. He
says the crater is oval, two miles in diameter; that the lake within
the crater is surrounded by level and solid ground; that there was a
deep chasm which had been recently ignited: there was sulphur enough to
load many ships. He saw a cube of porphyry 20 to 25 feet square. The
crater wall is perpendicular on all sides; that on the north 1,200 feet
high, the lowest exceeding 900 feet. He says he believes the south
sides to be of porphyry. At night, midway of the descent, he saw
&ldquo;thousands of millions&rdquo; of jets, whose gas immediately
inflamed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>on coming in contact with the atmosphere, and he
heard many small detonations. The waters of the lake were impregnated
with sulphuric acid, and 12 lbs. of the water, when distilled, left a
mineral residuum weighing 2&frac12; lbs.</p>
<p>There are many remarkable caves in the Philippines. I translate a
description of one in the province of Tondo. Two stony mountains unite,
and on their skirt is the road towards a branch of the main river. On
the left is a cave whose entrance fronts the south. The mouth is almost
covered with tangling vegetation, but it is arched, and, being all of
marble, is, particularly in the sunshine, strikingly beautiful. You
enter by a high, smooth, natural wall like the fa&ccedil;ade of a
church, over which is a cavity roofed as a chapel. The interior pathway
is flat, about four yards in breadth and six in height, though in some
places it is much loftier. The roof presents a multitude of graceful
figures, resembling pendent pineapples, which are formed by the
constant filtration and petrifaction of the water. Some are nearly two
yards in length, and seem sculptured into regular grooves; others are
in the shape of pyramids whose bases are against the roof. Arches,
which may be passed both from above and below, are among these
wonderful works. Not far from the door is a natural staircase, mounting
which you enter a large chamber, on whose right hand is another road,
which, being followed, conducts to a second staircase, which opens on
the principal communication. Suspended on one wing are immense numbers
of bats, who occupy the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>recesses of the ceiling. Though there
is mud in some of the paths, the ground is generally of stone, which,
on being struck, gives a hollow sound as if there were passages below.
Penetrating the cave for above 200 yards, a loud noise is perceived
coming from a clear bright river, by the side of which the cave is
continued under a semicircular roof. The great cave has many smaller
vaults and projections of a grotesque and Gothic character. The course
of the stream is from the north-west to the south-east.</p>
<p>The destructive ravages and changes produced by earthquakes are
nowhere more remarkable than in the Philippines. They have overturned
mountains, they have filled up valleys, they have desolated extensive
plains; they have opened passages for the sea into the interior, and
from the lakes into the sea There are many traditional stories of these
territorial revolutions, but of late disasters the records are
trustworthy. That of 1796 was sadly calamitous. In 1824 many churches
in Manila were destroyed, together with the principal bridge, the
barracks, great numbers of private houses; and a chasm opened of nearly
four miles in length. The inhabitants all fled into the fields, and the
six vessels in the port were wrecked. The number of victims was never
ascertained. In 1828, during another earthquake, the vibration of the
lamps was found to describe an arch of four and a half feet; the huge
corner-stones of the principal gate of the city were displaced; the
great bells were set ringing. It lasted between two and three minutes,
rent the walls of several churches and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>other buildings, but was
not accompanied by subterranean noises, as is usually the case.</p>
<p>There are too few occasions on which scientific observations have
been made on the subject of earthquakes, which take men by surprise and
ordinarily create so much alarm as to prevent accurate and authentic
details. A gentleman who had established various pendulums in Manila
for the purpose of measuring the inclination of the angles and the
course of the agitation, states that, in the slight earthquakes of 20th
and 23rd June, 1857, the thermometer being at 88&deg;, the direction of
the first shock was from N.N.E. to S.S.E., the duration 14 seconds, and
the oscillation of the pendulum 1&frac12; degrees; time, 2h. 0m. 40s.
<span class="sc">P.M.</span>: 20th June. Second shock from N.E. to
S.W.; duration, 26 seconds; oscillation of pendulum, 2 degrees; time,
2h. 47m. <span class="sc">P.M.</span>: 20th June. Third shock S.W. to
N.; duration of the shock, 15 seconds; greatest oscillation, 6 degrees,
but slight movements continued for a minute, and the oscillations were
observed from 2 degrees to three-quarters of a degree; time, 5
<span class="sc">P.M<span class="corr" id="xd21e1724" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span>: 23rd June.</p>
<p>Earthquakes have produced great changes in the geography of the
Philippines. In that of 1627, one of the most elevated of the mountains
of Cagayan disappeared. In 1675, in the island of Mindanao, a passage
was opened to the sea, and a vast plain was emerged. Successive
earthquakes have brought upon Luzon a series of calamities.</p>
<p>Endemic diseases are rare in the Philippines. Intermittent fevers
and chronic dysentery are among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83"
href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>the most dangerous disorders.
There have been two invasions of cholera, in 1820 and 1842.
Elephantiasis, leprosy, and St. Anthony&rsquo;s fire are the scourges
of the Indians; and the wilder races of the interior suffer from a
variety of cutaneous complaints. The biri biri is common and fatal.
Venereal diseases are widely spread, but easily cured. Among the
Indians, vegetables alone are used as medicaments. Chinese
quack-doctors have much influence. In the removal of some of the
tropical pests, no European can compete with the natives. They cure the
itch with great dexterity, and are said to have remedies for pulmonary
phthisis. Their plasters are very efficacious in external applications.
They never employ the lancet or the leech. Surgical science is, of
course, unknown.</p>
<p>There have been generally in the Philippines a few successful
medical practitioners from Europe. Foreigners are allowed to exercise
their profession, having previously obtained the authority of the
Spanish Government; but the natives seldom look beyond their own simple
mode of dealing with the common diseases of the islands; and in those
parts where there is little or no Spanish population, no one is to be
found to whom a surgical operation could safely be intrusted. The
vegetable world furnishes a great variety of medicinal herbs, which the
instinct or the experience of the Indian has turned to account, and
which are, probably, on the whole, as efficacious as the more potent
mineral remedies employed by European science. Quinine, opium, mercury,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>arsenic, are the wonder-workers in the field of
Oriental disease, and their early and proper application generally
arrests the progress of malady.</p>
<p>I found practising in the island of Panay Dr. Lefevre, whom I had
known in Egypt more than twenty years before, and who was one of the
courageous men who boldly grappled with the current superstitions
respecting the contagious character of the Oriental plague, and the
delusions as to the efficacy of quarantine regulations, so really
useless, costly, and vexatious. He placed in my hand some observations
which he had published at Bombay in 1840, where vessels from the Red
Sea were subjected to sanatory visitations. He asserts that plague is
only generated at particular seasons, in certain definable conditions
of the atmosphere, and when miasma is created by the decomposition of
decaying matter; that endemic plague is unknown in countries where
proper attention is paid to hygienic precautions; that severe cold or
intense heat equally arrests the progress of the plague; that the epoch
of its ravages is always one when damp and exposed animal and vegetable
substances emit the greatest amount of noxious gases; and that plague
has never been known to originate or to spread where the air is in a
state of purity. I was glad to rediscuss the matter with him after so
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1739" title="Source: ong">long</span> an
added experience, and to find he had been more and more confirmed in
his former conclusions by prolonged residence in the tropics, where
endemic and epidemic diseases partake of the pestilential character,
though they do not assume the forms, of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>Levant
plague. Dr. Lefevre affirms that quarantines have done nothing whatever
to lessen the dangers or check the ravages of the plague, but much to
encourage its propagation. He complains of the deafness and incredulity
of those whom the examination of a &ldquo;thousand indisputable
facts&rdquo; will not convince, and he thus concludes:&mdash;&ldquo;If
I had not with peculiar attention studied the plague in the midst of an
epidemic, and without any more precautions than if the danger was
nothing&mdash;if, subsequent to the terrible visitation of 1835 in
Egypt, I had not been frequently a witness to the scourge&mdash;if,
finally, since that epoch I had not given myself up, with all the
warmth of passion, to the constant study of this malady, to the perusal
of histories of the plagues which have ravaged the world, and to the
examination of all sorts of objections&mdash;I should not have dared to
emit such a decided opinion&mdash;an opinion respecting the soundness
of which I do not entertain the slightest doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One cannot but be struck, in reference to the geographical character
of these islands, with the awful serenity and magnificent beauty of
their primeval forests, so seldom penetrated, and in their recesses
hitherto inaccessible to the foot of man. There is nothing to disturb
their silence but the hum of insects, the song of birds, the noises of
wild animals, the rustling of the leaves, or the fall of decayed
branches. It seems as if vegetation revelled in undisturbed and
uncontrolled luxuriance. Creeping plants wander from tree to tree;
lovely orchids hang themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86"
href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>from trunks and boughs. One
asks, why is so much sweetness, so much glory, wasted? But is it
wasted? To the Creator the contemplation of his works, even where
unmarked by human eye, must be complacent; and these half-concealed,
half-developed treasures, are but reserved storehouses for man to
explore; they will furnish supplies to awaken the curiosity and gratify
the inquiry of successive ages. Rove where he may&mdash;explore as he
will&mdash;tax his intellect with research, his imagination with
inventions&mdash;there is, there will be, an infinite field around and
above him, inexhaustible through countless generations. <span class=

<h2 class="main">GOVERNMENT&mdash;ADMINISTRATION, ETC.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Administration of the Philippine Archipelago has
for its head and chief a captain and governor-general, who resides in
Manila, the capital of the islands, and who is not permitted to quit
them without the authority of the sovereign of Spain. Next to the
government of Cuba, it is the most important and the most lucrative
post at the disposal of the Cabinet of Madrid, and has unfortunately
been generally one of the prizes wrested from the unsuccessful, and
seized by the predominant, political party. It was rather a melancholy
employment for me to look over the collection of portraits of
captains-general, and many vacant frames waiting for future occupants,
which ornament the walls of the handsome apartments in which I dwelt at
the palace. Since 1835 there have been five provisional and eleven
formal appointments to the governor-generalship. Some of these only
held their authority for a few months, being superseded by ministerial
changes at Madrid. Of other high functionaries, I observe that there
have been only two archbishops since 1830, while it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>understood that the service of heads of
departments is assured for ten years. To the public interests the
mischiefs which are the results of so uncertain a hold of the supreme
authority are incalculable. The frequent and sudden removals and
nominations are, indeed, little consistent with the principles of
monarchical and hereditary government, however accordant with the
republican institutions of the Western world; and among the causes of
the slow development of the immense resources of these beautiful
islands, the fluctuation of the superintending rule is assuredly one of
the most prominent.</p>
<p>The titles of the captain-general occupy a page, and embrace the
usual attributes of government, with the exception of authority over
the fleet, which is subject to the Ministry of Marine in Spain, and a
somewhat limited jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters, which is a
consequence of the exclusive establishment of the Roman Catholic
faith.</p>
<p>The lieutenant-governor, who takes the place of the captain-general
in case of his death, is called the <i lang="es">Segundo Cabo</i>, or
second head.</p>
<p>The Philippine Islands are divided into provinces, subject either to
politico-military governors or alcaldes mayores, who are generally
civilians.</p>
<p>When the government is military, an assistant lieutenant-governor,
who must have graduated as a lawyer, exercises the preliminary
jurisdiction (<i lang="es">de primera instancia</i>), but the alcaldes
hold that jurisdiction in their own persons. Both dispose in their
provinces of the military authority, and have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>the
controlling direction of the collection of the revenues, under
responsibility to the General Administrator of Tributes.</p>
<p>The provinces are divided into <i lang="es">pueblos</i> (towns or
villages), over each of which a native Indian or mestizo, called a
<i lang="es">gobernadorcillo</i> (diminutive of governor) is placed. He
is assisted in the discharge of his functions by native lieutenants and
alguacils, whose number depends upon the extent of the population. This
body, which, when gathered together, is called the <i lang=
"es">principalia</i> of the pueblo, settles all minor matters of police
and civil questions between the natives as to rights of persons and
property. In districts where the Chinese or their descendants are
sufficiently numerous (they are known by the name of <i lang=
"es">Sangleyes</i>), they are allowed, under special authority of the
government, to select principalia from their own body, independently of
Indian jurisdiction. These principalia are really popularly chosen
municipalities, and they are specially charged to assist the clergy in
all matters connected with public worship and ecclesiastical authority.
They determine questions up to the amount of two taels of gold, or
forty-four silver dollars. They collect evidence in criminal cases,
which is submitted to the provincial chief; they assist in the
collection of the royal revenues, circulate the ordinances of the
government among the people, and are authorized to levy a small but
defined contribution in support of their dignity.</p>
<p>Besides these, there are in every pueblo certain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>functionaries who are called <i lang=
"es">Cabezas</i> (heads) <i lang="es">de Barangay</i>. A barangay is a
collection of the chiefs of families, or persons paying tribute,
generally amounting to forty or fifty. They are under the special
charge of the cabeza, who must dwell among them, and, under bond,
collect the tribute due to the State. He is required to settle
misunderstandings and to maintain peace and order, to apportion the
various charges among the members of the barangay, and to collect the
taxes for payment to the gobernadorcillo, or to the functionary
appointed for the purpose. The cabezas are also considered the <i lang=
"es">procuradores</i>, or law advisers, of these little
communities.</p>
<p>In ancient times there is little doubt that the office was
hereditary; and there are yet localities where the hereditary right is
maintained; but it is generally elective: and when a vacancy occurs,
the gobernadorcillo in council, with the other cabezas, presents a name
for the approval of the superior authority, and the same steps are
taken when the increase of population requires a new cabeza to be
nominated. The cabezas, their wives and first-born, who are required to
assist in the collection of the tribute, are exempted from its
payment.</p>
<p>In some provinces the cabezas are only chosen for three years; after
which they form part of the principalia, and take the title of Don. I
remember, in one locality, that the principalia who came to pay their
respects consisted of more than seventy persons. The government
complains of the number who, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>under this state of things, are
exempted from taxation, and I understand some measures are in
contemplation for limiting the extent of the privileges.</p>
<p>The elections of the gobernadorcillo are annual, and take place on
the 1st of April. An extraordinary excitement generally prevails, the
post (a really important, popular, and influential one) being an object
of much ambition. Three names are selected, one of whom must have
already served as gobernadorcillo, for submission to the superior
authority, on or before the 15th of May, and the chosen gobernadorcillo
enters on his functions on the 1st of June. There is, however, some
alteration of dates, where, as in the tobacco districts, the period of
election interferes with harvest time.</p>
<p>The head of the province ordinarily presides over the elections, to
which the principal ecclesiastic is also invited. In case of their
absence, any native-born Spaniard may be nominated by the principal
authority to preside.</p>
<p>There are thirteen electors for each pueblo&mdash;the
gobernadorcillo and twelve inhabitants&mdash;half of whom must have
been gobernadorcillos or cabezas, and the other half be in the actual
exercise of those functions; they must also have some well-recognized
means of existence: domestic servants to the authorities are excluded;
as also those who have been punished as criminals.</p>
<p>It is further required that the gobernadorcillo be a native Indian
or mestizo, an inhabitant of the locality where he serves, and above
twenty-five years old; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92"
name="pb92">92</a>]</span>having passed the subordinate offices of
lieutenant or cabeza, having his accounts in order, holding no land
from the community, and no monopoly (<i lang="es">estanco</i>) from the
government. Similar recommendations are insisted on for the first
lieutenant and the principal (native) magistrates appointed for the
settlement of questions regarding seed-sowing, police, and cattle.
These magistrates must have enjoyed the rank of gobernadorcillo. As
regards the minor officers of justice and their attendants, a list is
to be made out by the gobernadorcillo before quitting office, which is
to be presented to the authority presiding over the elections, and
having heard the clergyman (<i lang="es">cura</i>) and the committee of
election, the president approves the list for transmission to the
supreme authority; but if he finds discordance and irreconcilable
opinions between the parties before him, he is authorized himself to
recommend the officers for nomination.</p>
<p>All the proceedings are the subjects of record, and to be signed by
the president, the curate (if present), the electors, and the public
notary, and to be remitted to the supreme authority, except in the
provinces adjacent to the capital. The president may attach to the
record any observations of his own connected with the returns. A decree
of 1850 required the general adoption of the system which has been
described, and which appears to me well worthy of note, showing how
many valuable elements of good government are to be found in the
popular institutions of the Philippine Indians.</p>
<p>The Chinese of the capital may elect Christian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>converts
of their own body, under the presidency of the alcalde mayor of Manila,
to the offices of gobernadorcillo, first lieutenant, and principal
<i lang="es">alguacil</i> (bailiff). The dependent subordinate officers
of justice are called <i lang="es">bilangos</i>, and are appointed by
the gobernadorcillo on his election. The recovery of the tribute or
taxes from the Chinese is not left to their principalia, but is
effected by the alcalde mayor or superior chief. An officer is
appointed to classify the Chinese, and apportion the quota of their
contributions according to the wealth of the payer, who is charged for
what is called a <i lang="es">patente industrial</i>.</p>
<p>The gobernadorcillos and officers of justice are entitled to sit in
the presence of the provincial chiefs, who are to require the parochial
clergy to treat them with due honour and regard.</p>
<p>M. Mallat, whose Geographical History of the Philippines was
published in 1846, remarks that, of all colonies founded by Europeans,
these regions are perhaps the least known, and the most worthy of being
known. The number of islands which compose the archipelago,&mdash;their
vast extent and boundless variety,&mdash;the teeming population of many
of them,&mdash;the character of the climate,&mdash;the wonderful
fertility of the soil,&mdash;the inexhaustible riches of hill, valley,
and plain,&mdash;all offer to cultivation and its civilizing influences
abundant rewards. But as regards the &ldquo;industrious habits&rdquo;
of the natives, I cannot place that consideration, as M. Mallat does,
among the elements of hope. It is the want of these &ldquo;industrious
habits,&rdquo; among four or five millions of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>inhabitants, which has left the Philippines in a
position so little advanced.</p>
<p>Java under the government of the Dutch, and Cuba subjected to the
Spanish rule, present, no doubt, far more favourable pictures than do
the Philippines; but many of the difficulties which surround the
captain-general of Manila,&mdash;difficulties both religious and
social,&mdash;do not embarrass the governor of Batavia; the island of
Java, the most productive of Netherlands India, being peculiarly free
from these difficulties; and it cannot be said that Sumatra and Borneo
are even on a level with the more advanced of the Philippine
Islands.</p>
<p>To the character of the original conquest and of the earlier
government of the Philippines may be traced many of the impediments
which now stand in the way of improvement. In America and the West
Indies all the brutality of military conquerors was exhibited, and the
possession and plunder of new territories were encouraged by the
Spanish court, and were the main object of the Spanish invader. But far
different was the policy adopted in the Philippines, where only a small
body of soldiers was accompanied by zealous missionaries, whose purpose
was rather to convert and christianize the Indians than to pillage and
destroy them. These friars gradually obtained a paramount influence
over the Indians. The interests of trade have ever been the predominant
consideration among Dutch colonizers, and among British adventurers the
commercial element has always been intimately associated with the
desire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>for territorial occupation. To the Spaniards it
must be conceded that the religious purpose&mdash;be its value what it
may&mdash;has never been abandoned or forgotten. Ecclesiastical
jurisdiction and authority are interwoven in the Philippines with the
machinery of government and the daily concerns of life.</p>
<p>And such ecclesiastical action has been comparatively little
interfered with in the Philippines. The development which mental
emancipation has given to many Protestant countries and their
dependencies has reached few Catholic colonies; nor is that
emancipation, indeed, consistent with the more rigid discipline and
doctrines of Rome. But in the case of the most prosperous instances of
colonization by the British, the native races have either wholly
disappeared or are in progress of extinction, while the infusion of
Spanish and foreign blood into the colonies of Spain has not only
allowed the increase of the indigenous population, but has been
insufficient to change or do more than slightly modify their national
characters. It has undoubtedly been the boast of the Catholics that
Francis de Xavier and his followers won more for the Roman Church in
the East than Luther or Calvin ever tore away from it in the West; but
the value of the conquests, contrasted with that of the losses and
sacrifices, if fairly estimated, would hardly be deemed unsatisfactory
to the Protestant cause.</p>
<p>No doubt the great remoteness of the Philippines from Europe, the
difficulties and infrequency of communication, gave to the local
authorities more of independent action than would otherwise have been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>allowed to them; and in case of the death of the
governor, the archbishop was generally the functionary who filled his
place; his adjacency to the government, and frequent direction of it,
naturally led to the strengthening of his own authority and that of all
ecclesiastics dependent upon him.</p>
<p>In the earlier periods of Eastern colonization, too, the Portuguese,
jealous of all European intercourse but their own with nations east of
the Cape, did all in their power to prevent any other than the
Lusitanian flag from being seen in Oriental waters. But as regards
missionary objects their views were to some extent concurrent with
those of the Spanish priests, and their proceedings were in harmony
with those of the Spaniards, especially in so far as both received
their direction from the Pontiff at Rome. It ought not, however, to be
forgotten that whatever may have been the progress of Christianity in
the Philippines, the persecutions, disasters, discomfiture, and death
of so many professing Christians in Japan, are probably attributable to
the ill-guided zeal of the Portuguese preachers of the Gospel in these
still remoter regions. It is well for the interests of truth, as most
assuredly it is for the interests of commerce and civilization, that a
more temperate and tolerant spirit has for the last century been
associated with the progress of European influence in the East.</p>
<p>The comparatively small number of Spanish settlers in the
Philippines would not allow them, even if such had been their purpose,
which it does not appear to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>have been, unnecessarily to interfere
with the usages of the Indians, or their forms of administration and
government, except in so far as their conversion to Christianity
compelled the observance of the Christian rites; and the friars
willingly accommodated their action to the social habits of the people,
respecting, as to this hour are respected, most of the patriarchal
forms of administration and government which had existed among them
from immemorial time.</p>
<p>There have been speculations&mdash;and M. Mallat is among the
sanguine anticipators of such an advent&mdash;that in process of time
the Philippines may become the dominant political power of the Eastern
world, subjecting to its paramount influence the Netherlands
Archipelago, the Pacific, Australia, and even China and Japan, and that
Manila is destined to be the great emporium for the eastern and
south-eastern world. M. Mallat even goes further, and says:
&ldquo;Manila might easily become the centre of the exports and imports
of the entire globe.&rdquo; It must be contented with a less brilliant
futurity. Certainly its commercial relations might be greatly extended,
and the Spanish archipelago be much elevated in value and in influence;
but in the vast development of commercial relations in the Oriental
world, the Philippines must be contented with a moderate though a
considerable share of benefit, even under the best administration and
the adoption of the wisest policy.</p>
<p>Tropical regions fail to attract permanent settlers from the West.
The foreign merchant comes to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>realize what he deems an adequate
fortune, and to withdraw; the superior public functionary is among, or
above, but never of, the people. What must be looked to is the popular
element. Of what are the millions composed, and how can the millions be
turned to account? There is no reason to apprehend that these millions
will aspire to political power or sovereignty. Their pristine habits
would permit of no general organization. The various races and clans
would never unite in a national object, or recognize one native chief.
All that is found of order and government among them is local; except
through and for their masters, the different islands have little or no
intercourse with one another. The Tag&aacute;l and the Bisayan have no
common sympathies. Dissatisfaction might produce disorder, which, if
not controlled, would lead to anarchy, but not to good government.</p>
<p>The Philippines are free from the curse of slavery. Time will settle
the controversy as to whether the labour of the freeman can, in the
long run, be brought into competition with that of the slave,
especially in the tropics; but that the great tide of tendency flows
towards the abolition of slavery, that civilizing opinion and
enlightened Christian legislation must sweep the ignominy away, is a
conviction which possesses the minds of all who see
&ldquo;progress&rdquo; in the world.</p>
<p>As it is, the Philippines have made, and continue to make, large
contributions to the mother country, generally in excess of the
stipulated amount which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=
"#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>is called the <i lang=
"es">situado</i>. Spain, in her extreme embarrassment, has frequently
called on the Philippines to come to her aid, and it is to the credit
of the successive governors-general that, whatever may have been the
financial disorders at home, the dependants upon the Manila treasury
have had little motive for complaint, and while the Peninsula was
engaged in perilous struggles for her independence, and even her
existence as a nation, the public tranquillity of her island colonies
was, on the whole, satisfactorily maintained, and interruptions to the
ordinary march of affairs of short endurance.</p>
<p>There would seem to be no legislation defining the powers of the
viceroy, or captain-general; but whenever any important matter is under
discussion, it is found that reference must be made to Madrid, and that
the supreme rule of this vast archipelago is in the leading strings of
the Spanish Cabinet, impotent to correct any great abuses, or to
introduce any important reforms. The captain-general should be invested
with a large amount of power, subject, of course, to a personal
responsibility as to its becoming exercise. As he must, if properly
selected, know more, being present, than strangers who are absent, his
government should be trusted on account of that superior knowledge.
Well does the Castilian proverb say, &ldquo;Mas sabe el loco en su casa
que el cuerdo en la agena&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The fool knows more about
his own house than the sage about the house of another.&rdquo; He
should be liberally paid, that the motives for corruption be
diminished. He should be surrounded by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>council composed of
the best qualified advisers. Many objects would necessarily occupy the
attention of such a body, and it would naturally have to create
becoming local machinery and to furnish the materials for improved
administration, such as surveys and statistics of the land and
population, which would lead to a more satisfactory distribution of
provinces, districts and pueblos. A simple code of civil and criminal
law would be a great blessing, and should be grounded, in so far as the
real interests of justice will allow, upon the customs and habits of
the people, while employing, when compatible with those interests, the
administrative local machinery in use among the natives.</p>
<p>Nothing would be more beneficial to the interests of Manila than the
establishment of an efficient board of works, with provincial
ramifications, to whose attention the facilitating communications
should be specially recommended. The cost and difficulty of transport
are among the principal impediments to the development of the resources
of the islands, and the tardy progress of the few works which are
undertaken is discouraging to those who suggest, and disappointing to
those who expect to benefit by them. In many of the provinces the
bridges are in miserable condition, and the roads frequently
impassable. Even in the populous island of Panay delays the most costly
and annoying interfere with the transport of produce to the capital and
naturally impede the development of commerce. There is, no doubt, a
great want of directing talent and of that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>special knowledge which modern science is able
to furnish. The construction of bridges being generally left to the
rude artists who are employed by the Spanish functionaries, or to the
direction of the friars, with whom the <i lang="la">stare super
antiquas vias</i> is the generally received maxim, it is not wonderful
that there should be so many examples of rude, unsafe and unsightly
constructions. Moreover, estimates have to be sent to the capital of
all the proposed outlay, and it is hardly to be expected but that sad
evidence should be found&mdash;as elsewhere&mdash;of short-sighted and
very costly economy. The expense, too, almost invariably exceeds the
estimates&mdash;a pretty general scandal; then the work is arrested,
and sometimes wholly abandoned. Funds there are none, and neither
policy nor patriotism will provide them. Even when strongly impelled,
the Indian moves slowly; self-action for the promotion of the public
good he has none. There is no pressure from without to force
improvements upon the authorities, and hence little is to be hoped for
as to improvement except from direct administrative action.</p>
<p>I can hardly pass over unnoticed M. de la Gironi&egrave;re&rsquo;s
<a class="pglink xd21e43" title="Link to Project Gutenberg ebook" href=
"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21804">romantic book</a>,<a class=

as it was the subject of frequent conversations in the Philippines. No
doubt he has dwelt there twenty years; but in the experience of those
who have lived there more than twice twenty I found little confirmation
of the strange stories which are crowded into his strange <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>volume. He was a resident of the Philippines at
the time of my visit, and I believe still lives on the property of
which he was formerly&mdash;but I was told is no longer&mdash;the
possessor.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1903src" href="#xd21e1903" name=
"xd21e1903src">2</a> I did not visit his &ldquo;Paradise,&rdquo; but
had some agreeable intercourse with a French gentleman who is now in
charge. I did not find any of that extraordinary savagery with which M.
de la Gironi&egrave;re represents himself to be surrounded; and the
answer to the inquiries I made of the neighbouring authorities as to
the correctness of his pictures of Indian character was generally a
shrug and a smile and a reference to my own experience. But M. de la
Gironi&egrave;re may have aspired to the honour of a Bernardin de St.
Pierre or a Defoe, and have thought a few fanciful and tragic
decorations would add to the interest of his personal drama. &ldquo;All
the world&rsquo;s a stage,&rdquo; and as a player thereon M. de la
Gironi&egrave;re perhaps felt himself authorized in the indulgence of
some latitude of description, especially when his chosen
&ldquo;stage&rdquo; was one meant to exhibit the wonders of travel.</p>
<p>As to M. de la Gironi&egrave;re&rsquo;s marvellous encounters and
miraculous escapes from man and beast; his presence at feasts where
among the delicacies were human brains, steeped by young girls in the
juice of sugar-cane, of which he did not drink, but his servant did;
his discoveries of native hands in &ldquo;savory&rdquo; pots
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>prepared for food; his narratives where the rude
Indians tell elaborate tales in the lackadaisy style of a fantastic
novel; his vast possessions; his incredible influence over ferocious
bandits and cruel savages;&mdash;all this must be taken at its value. I
confess I have seen with some surprise, in M. de la
Gironi&egrave;re&rsquo;s book, two &ldquo;testimonies&rdquo; from M.
Dumont d&rsquo;Urville and Admiral La Place, in which, among other
matters, they give an account of the hatching of eggs by men specially
engaged for this purpose.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1910src" href=
"#xd21e1910" name="xd21e1910src">3</a> They saw, as any one may, in the
villages on the Pasig River, prodigious quantities of ducks and
ducklings, and were &ldquo;puzzled&rdquo; to find how such multitudes
could be produced; but they learnt the wonderful feat was accomplished
by &ldquo;lazy Tag&aacute;l Indians,&rdquo; who lay themselves down
upon the eggs, which are placed in ashes. The patient incubators eat,
drink, smoke, and chew their betel, and while they take care not to
injure the fragile shells, they carefully remove the ducklings as they
are brought into being (pp. 358 and 362). Now it may well be asked who
takes care when the lazy Tag&aacute;ls are asleep; and, if our worthy
witnesses had reflected for a moment, they would have known that, if
<i>all</i> the inhabitants were employed in no other office than that
of egg-hatching, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span>they would be hardly sufficient to incubate
the &ldquo;prodigious&rdquo; numbers of ducklings which disport on the
banks of the Pasig. The incubation is really produced by placing warm
paddy husks under and over the eggs; they are deposited in frames; a
canvas covering is spread over the husks; the art is to keep up the
needful temperature; and one man is sufficient to the care of a large
number of frames, from which he releases the ducklings as they are
hatched, and conveys them in little flocks to the water-side. The
communities are separated from one another by bamboo fences, but there
is scarcely a cottage with a river frontage which has not its <i lang=
"es">patero</i> (or duckery). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">POPULATION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the last generation a wonderful sensation was
produced by the propagation of the great Malthusian discovery&mdash;the
irresistible, indisputable, inexorable truth&mdash;that the productive
powers of the soil were less and less able to compete with the
consuming demands of the human race; that while population was
increasing with the rapidity of a swift geometrical progression, the
means of providing food lagged with the feebleness of a slow
arithmetical advance more and more behind; that the seats at
nature&rsquo;s table&mdash;rich and abundant though it was&mdash;were
being abundantly filled, and that there was no room for superfluous and
uninvited guests; in a word, to use the adopted formula, that
population was pressing more and more upon subsistence, and that the
results must be increasing want, augmenting misery, and a train of
calamities boundless as the catalogue of the infinite forms of mortal
wretchedness.</p>
<p>How often, when threading through the thousand islands of the
Philippine Archipelago, did the shadow of Malthus and the visions of
his philosophy present themselves to my thoughts. Of those unnumbered,
sea-surrounded regions, how many there are that have never been trodden
by European foot, how few that have been thoroughly explored, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>fewer still that are now inhabited by any
civilized or foreign race! And yet they are covered with beautiful and
spontaneous vegetable riches above, and bear countless treasures of
mineral wealth below; their powers of production are boundless; they
have the varieties of climate which mountains, valleys and plains
afford&mdash;rains to water&mdash;suns to ripen&mdash;rivers to
conduct&mdash;harbours for shipment&mdash;every recommendation to
attract adventure and to reward industry; a population of only five or
six millions, when ten times that number might be supplied to satiety,
and enabled to provide for millions upon millions more out of the
superfluities of their means.</p>
<p>To what a narrow field of observation must the mind have been
confined that felt alarm at a discovery, in itself of so little
importance, when brought into the vast sphere of the world&rsquo;s
geography! Though the human race has been increasing at a rapid and
almost immeasurable rate, it will be probably found that famines, and
plagues, and wars, and those calamitous visitations which were deemed
the redressers of the balance&mdash;the restorers of the due
proportions between man&rsquo;s wants and man&rsquo;s
supplies&mdash;were far more disastrous in ancient than in modern
times, if the smaller number of then existing human beings be taken
into consideration.</p>
<p>The nobler and higher axiom is that &ldquo;progress&rdquo; is the
law of Providence, which never fails, while the race of man proceeds in
ever-augmenting numbers, to provide ample means for their maintenance
and happiness. Neither land nor sea is exhausted nor in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>process of exhaustion. What myriads of acres,
whether in cold, temperate, or tropical climes, remain to be
appropriated! what still greater amount to be improved by cultivation!
And while in the more densely peopled parts of the world outlets may be
required for those who are ill at ease and born to no inheritance but
labour, how wonderfully are locomotive facilities increased, so that
the embarrassment to ambulatory man is less to discover a fit place for
his domicile, than to select one amid the many which offer themselves
to his choice! If the poverty-struck Irish could emigrate in such
multitudes to American or Australian regions, far greater are the
facilities possessed by those better conditioned labouring masses of
Europe who are still heavily pressed by the competition of neighbours
more fortunate than themselves.</p>
<p>It is a matter of surprise that the Spanish colonies should not have
attracted a greater number of Spaniards to settle in them; but the
national spirit of the Iberian peninsula has ceased to be ambulatory or
adventurous. Spain itself is thinly peopled, and offers great resources
to its satisfied peasantry. &ldquo;God,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;has
given everything to Spain which He had to give. Our land is an
Eden&mdash;why should we desert it?&rdquo; Yet Spain, backward, inert
and unenergetic, as she has proved herself to be in the rivalry of
active nations, has taken her part in the proud history of human
advancement. The more enterprising invaders of Gothic or Anglo-Saxon
blood have frequently extirpated the indigenous races of the remote
countries in which they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>have settled. One wave of
emigration has followed another; commerce and cultivation have created
a demand for, and provided a supply of, the intrusive visitors. But
Spain has never furnished such numbers as to dislodge the aboriginal
tribes. Her colonists have been always accompanied by large bodies of
ecclesiastics, bent upon bringing &ldquo;the heathen&rdquo; into the
Christian fold. These missionaries have no doubt often stood between
the cupidity of the conqueror and the weakness of the conquered. They
have preserved, by protecting the Indian clans, and it may be doubted
whether ultimately the permanent interests of man will not have been
served by influences, whose beneficial consequences may remain when the
most prominent evils connected with those influences may be greatly
modified or wholly pass away.</p>
<p>My observations and my reflections, then, lead to this
conclusion&mdash;that, whatever exceptional cases there may be, the
great tide of advancement rolls <span class="corr" id="xd21e1946"
title="Source: foward">forward</span> in ever-growing
strength;&mdash;that the course of the Divine government is</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first xd21e126">From seeming evil still educing
<i>good</i>,<br>
And <span class="sc">BETTER</span> thence again, and BETTER still,<br>
In infinite progression;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>that the human family, taken as a whole, is constantly
improving;&mdash;that every generation is wiser and better than that
which preceded it;&mdash;that the savage and least improvable races
will continue to be supplanted or absorbed by those of a higher
intelligence;&mdash;that the semi-civilized will only be perpetuated by
contact with a greater civilization, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>will
raise them in the scale of humanity. A middle race, such as China
contributes in the shape of emigrating millions, is wonderfully
advancing the work of civilization. The process is everywhere visible
in the remoter Eastern world. The mestizo descendants of Chinese
fathers and Indian mothers form incomparably the most promising portion
of the Philippine population. In Siam, Burmah, Cochin China, profitable
employments are mainly absorbed by Chinese settlers. In Netherlands
India they are almost invariably prosperous. To them Sumatra, Borneo,
and the other islands, must look, and not to the indigenous peoples,
for any considerable development of their resources. In our Straits
Archipelago they have superseded the <i>Klings</i> in all the most
beneficial fields of labour, as the Klings had previously superseded
the less industrious <i>Malays</i>. The progress of the higher
capabilities, and the depression of the lower, may be traced in the
extinction of so many rude languages and the spread of those which
represent civilization in its most advanced stages. It may be foretold,
I think, without presumption, that in some future time the number of
tongues spoken on the face of the globe will be reduced to a very small
amount. In the course of a century many a local idiom utterly perishes,
and is invariably replaced by one of more extensive range and greater
utility. When it is remembered that the <i>written</i> language of
China is understood by one-third of the human race; that probably more
than one-tenth of mankind have an acquaintance with <i>spoken</i>
English<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>&mdash;the language which has far more widely
planted roots, and more extensive ramifications, than any other; when
the daily decay of the provincial dialects of France, Germany, Spain,
and Italy is watched, good ground will be discovered for the
anticipation that many of the existing instruments for oral
communication will be extinguished, the number of dead languages will
be much augmented, and of living proportionally decreased.</p>
<p>I know not on what authority M. Mallat estimated, in 1846, the
population of the Philippines at 7,000,000,&mdash;an augmentation, he
says, of more than 50 per cent from 1816, when he states the population
to have been 4,600,000. He says that it quadrupled itself from 1774 to
1816. He attributes the enormous increase from the later period to the
introduction of vaccination and the general tranquillity of the
country; but the correctness of the data may well be doubted.</p>
<p>The Christian population of the Philippines is stated by Father Juan
Fernandez to be&mdash;</p>

<p>The number of European Spaniards settled in the Philippines bears a
very small proportion to that of the mixed races. There are 670 males
and 119 females in the capital (Manila and Binondo). Of these there are
114 friars, all living in Manila, eight ecclesiastics, forty-six
merchants, fourteen medical practitioners, and the majority of the
others military and civil functionaries. But in none of the islands
does the proportion of Spaniards approach that which is found in the
capital. Probably the whole number of European Spaniards in the islands
does not amount to two thousand.</p>
<p>There are ninety-six foreigners established in
Binondo&mdash;eighty-five males and eleven females (none in Manila
proper). Of these fifty are merchants or merchants&rsquo; assistants.
There are twenty-two British subjects, fifteen French, fifteen South
Americans, eleven citizens of the United States, nine Germans, and nine
Swiss.</p>
<p>Independently of European Spaniards, there are many families which
call themselves <i lang="es">hijos del pays</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>(children of the country), descendants of
Spanish settlers, who avoid mingling with native Indian blood. They
have the reputation of being more susceptible than are even the old
Castilians in matters of etiquette, and among them are many who have
received a European education. They are generally candidates for public
employment, but are said to be less steady, and more addicted to play
and to pleasure, than their progenitors; but they are eminently
hospitable. They dress in European style when they appear in public,
but at home both men and women use the loose and more convenient Indian
costume. They complain, on their part, that barriers are raised between
them and their countrymen from the Peninsula; in a word, that the
spirit of caste exercises its separating and alienating influences in
the Philippines, as elsewhere.</p>
<p>The mestizos, or mixed races, form a numerous and influential
portion of the Filipinos; the number settled in the islands of women of
European birth is small, and generally speaking they are the wives of
the higher Spanish functionaries and of superior officers in the army
and navy, whose term of service is generally limited. Though the
daughters of families of pure Spanish blood generally marry in the
colony and keep up a good deal of exclusiveness and caste, it is seldom
that the highest society is without a large proportion of mestiza
ladies, children of Spanish fathers and native mothers. The great
majority of the merchants and landed proprietors belong to this class,
and most of the subordinate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>offices of government are filled
by them. There are very many descendants of Chinese by native women;
but the paternal type seems so to absorb the maternal, that the
children for whole generations bear the strongly marked character which
distinguishes the genuine native of the flowery land, even through a
succession of Indian mothers. I shall have occasion to speak of a visit
I made to a district (Molo, near Iloilo), which in former times had
been the seat of a large Chinese colony, where the Chinese race had
disappeared centuries ago, but the Chinese physiognomy, and the Chinese
character, had left their <span class="corr" id="xd21e2772" title=
"Source: unmistakeable">unmistakable</span> traces in the whole
population. I found nowhere among the natives a people so industrious,
so persevering, so economical, and, generally, so prosperous. Almost
every house had a loom, and it is the place where the best of the
pi&ntilde;a fabrics are woven. We were invited to a ball at which the
principal native ladies were present, and I had to answer a <i lang=
"es">discurso</i> delivered in excellent Castilian by the leading
personage. I was informed that the young women were remarkable for
their chastity, and that an erring sister obtained no forgiveness among
them. Their parents object to their learning Spanish lest it should be
an instrument of seduction. Of the mestizos of Chinese or Mongolian
descent, De Mas says:&mdash;&ldquo;They are called <i lang=
"es">Sangley</i>, which means Chinese merchant or traveller. They
inherit the industrious and speculative spirit of their forefathers.
Most of them have acquired riches and lands, and the largest part of
the retail trade is in their hands. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>They form the middle
class of the Filipinos. Their prosperity and better education produce
the natural results, and their moral and intellectual character is far
superior to that of the Indians. They are luxuriously dressed, are more
elegant and handsome than the Indians; some of their women are
decidedly beautiful. But they preserve most of the habits of the
Indians, whom they exceed in attention to religious duties because they
are superior in intelligence. This race is likely to increase in
numbers and in influence, and, in consequence of the large importation
of Chinamen, to augment in the localities of their settlements at a
greater rate than the Indian population.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2784src" href="#xd21e2784" name="xd21e2784src">1</a></p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the predominance of the characteristics
of the father over those of the mother has improved, through successive
generations, the general character of the race of mestizo Chinese. They
are more active and enterprising, more prudent and persevering, more
devoted to trade and commerce, than the Indios. They all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>preserve the black hair, which is characteristic
of China, &ldquo;the black-haired&rdquo; being one of the national
names by which the people of the &ldquo;middle kingdom&rdquo; are fond
of designating themselves. The slanting position of the eyes, forming
an angle over the nose, the beardless chin, the long and delicate
fingers (in conformity with Chinese usage they frequently allow the
middle nail of the left hand to grow to a great length), their fondness
for dress and ornament, distinguish them. They exercise great influence
over the Indians, who believe them to be masters of the art of
money-getting. The children of a Spanish mestizo by a Chinese mestiza,
are called <i lang="es">Torna atras</i>, &ldquo;going back;&rdquo;
those of a Chinese mestizo by an Indian woman are considered as Chinese
and not Indian half-castes. The mingling of Chinese blood is observable
in all the town populations. The number of mestizos of European descent
is trifling compared with those of Chinese origin. Their houses are
invariably better furnished than those of the natives. Many of them
adopt the European costume, but where they retain the native dress it
is finer in quality, gayer in colours, and richer in ornament. Like the
natives, they wear their shirts over the trousers, but the shirt is of
pi&ntilde;a or <i>sinamay</i> fastened with buttons of valuable stones;
and a gold chain is seldom wanting, suspended round the neck. The men
commonly wear European hats, shoes and stockings, and the sexes exhibit
no small amount of dandyism and coquetry.</p>
<p>The great mass of the indigenous population of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>Philippine Islands may be divided into two
principal races&mdash;the <i>Tag&aacute;los</i> occupying the north,
and the <i>Bis&aacute;yos</i> the south. Of these, all who inhabit the
towns and villages profess Christianity, and are much under the
influence of the regular clergy, who administer the religious
ordinances in the various provinces, which are, for the most part,
submitted to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of different orders of
brotherhood. There are a few instances of the Indians being invested
with the full rights of priesthood, though they generally reach no
higher post than that of assistants to the friars. At the great
ceremony which I attended of the <i lang="la">Purisima Conception</i>
at Manila, an Indian was chosen to deliver the sermon of the day; it
was, as usual, redolent with laudations of the Virgin, and about equal
to the average style of flowery Spanish preaching. But as we recede
from the towns, religious ordinances are neglected, and in the centre
and mountainous parts of the islands Christianity ceases to be the
profession of the inhabitants; the friars deplore their ignorant and
abandoned state, and occupy themselves in the endeavour to bring them
into their fold, and to enforce the payment of that <i lang=
"es">tributo</i> from which they, as well as the government, derive
their revenues. If this be paid, if the services of the Church be duly
performed, confession made, fit co-operation given to the religious
processions and festivals (which are the native holidays), matters go
on well between the clergy and the people. I found many of the friars
objects of affection and reverence, and deservedly so, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>as
guardians and restorers of the family peace, encouragers of the
children in their studies, and otherwise associating their efforts with
the well-being of the community; but removed, as the ecclesiastics
frequently are, from the control of public opinion, there is often
scandal, and good ground for it.</p>
<p>Father Zu&ntilde;iga opines that the Philippines were originally
colonized by the inhabitants of America; but he fails altogether in the
proofs he seeks in the analogy of languages. The number of Malayan
words in Tagal and Bisayan is greater than any to be traced to American
dialects; and here I may remark, by the way, that there is no topic on
which so much absurdity has been committed to the press as on the
derivation and affinity of languages&mdash;a subject in which Spanish
authority is seldom of much value. El Se&ntilde;or Erro, for example,
in his book on the antiquity of the Bascuence, gives a description and
picture of a jar found in a well in Guipuscoa, which had on it the
words &ldquo;<span lang="de">Gott erbarme dein armes
W&uuml;rmchen!</span>&rdquo; This he reports to be a Biscayan
inscription in honour of the priestesses of the sun anterior to the
introduction of Christianity, and he doubts not that the vase (a piece
of coarse modern German pottery) was used in the sacred services of the
temple!</p>
<p>De Mas supposes that the Indians employed alphabetical writing
anterior to the arrival of the Spanish, and gives five alphabets as
used in different provinces, but having some resemblance to one
another. I doubt alike the antiquity and authenticity of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>records; but give a specimen which he says is a
contract upon Chinese paper for a sale of land in Bulacan, dated
1652.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2825width"><img src="images/p119.png" alt=
"Sample of old Tagalog script." width="501" height="223"></div>
<p>My own inquiries led to no discoveries of old records, or written
traditions, or inscriptions of remote times, associated with Indian
history. There is sufficient evidence that some rude authority
existed&mdash;that there were masters and slaves&mdash;that the land
was partially cultivated and the sea explored by labourers and
fishermen, leading necessarily to a recognition of some rights of
property&mdash;that there were wars between hostile tribes, which had
their leaders and their laws. The early records of the missionaries
give the names of some of the chiefs, and detail the character of the
authority exercised by the ruling few over the subject many. They say
that gold would procure the emancipation of a slave and his reception
among the <i>Mahaldicas</i>, or privileged class. Prisoners of war,
debtors, and criminals, were held in bonds. The daughter of a Mahaldica
could be obtained in marriage, where the lover was unable to pay her
money value, by vassalage to her father for a certain number of years.
If a man of one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120"
name="pb120">120</a>]</span>tribe married the woman of another, the
children were equally, or as nearly as possible, divided among the two
tribes to which the parents belonged. Property was partitioned among
the sons at the father&rsquo;s death, the elder enjoying no rights over
the younger.</p>
<p>Local superstitions prevailed as to rocks, trees, and rivers. They
worshipped the sun and moon; a blue bird called <i lang=
"tl">tigmamanoquin</i>; a stag named <i lang="tl">meylupa</i>,
&ldquo;lord of the soil;&rdquo; and the crocodile, to which they gave
the title of <i lang="tl">nono</i>, or &ldquo;grandfather.&rdquo; A
demon named Osuang was supposed to torment children, to cause pains in
childbirth, to live on human flesh, and to have his presence announced
by the <i lang="tl">tictic</i>, a bird of evil augury. Naked men
brandished swords from the roof and other parts of the <i>choza</i> to
frighten the fiend away, or the pregnant woman was removed from the
neighbourhood of the tictic. The <i lang="tl">Manacolam</i> was a
monster enveloped in flames, which could only be extinguished by the
ordure of a human being, whose death would immediately follow. The
<i>Silagan</i> seized and tore out the liver of persons clad in white.
The <i lang="tl">Magtatangal</i> deposited his head and entrails in the
evening in some secret place, wandered about doing mischief in the
night, and resumed his &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; at break of day. So
strange and wild are the fancies of credulity! Sacrifices were offered
in deprecation of menaced evils, or in compliment to visitors, by
female priestesses called <i>Catalona</i>, who distributed pieces of
the sacrificed animal. There were many witches and sorcerers,
exercising various functions, one of whom, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>the
<i lang="tl">Manyisalat</i>, was the love inspirer and the confidant of
youths and maidens.</p>
<p>On entering a forest the Indian supplicated the demons not to molest
him. The crackling of wood, the sight of a snake in a cottage newly
built, were deemed presages of evil. In the house of a fisherman it was
deemed improper to speak of a forest, in that of a huntsman of the sea.
A pregnant woman was not allowed to cut her hair, lest her child should
he horn hairless.</p>
<p>The price paid for a woman given in marriage was regulated by the
position of the parties. The mother had a claim, as well as the nurse
who had had charge of the childhood of the bride. Whatever expense the
daughter had caused to the father he was entitled to recover from the
bridegroom. Among opulent families there was a traditional price, such
as the father or grandfather had paid for their wives. If the bride had
no living parents, her price was paid to herself. Three days before the
marriage the roof of the parental dwelling was extended, and an
apartment, called a <i lang="tl">palapala</i>, added for the wedding
festival; the guests brought their presents to the bride, and, whatever
the value, it was expected that when, on future occasions, the
relations of hosts and guests were changed, an offering of not less
value should be given. Among the ceremonies it was required that the
lovers should eat from the same plate and drink from the same cup.
Mutual pledges and promises of affection were given, and the catalona
pronounced a benediction. Sad scenes of drunkenness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>and
scandal are said to have followed the ceremony in the after
festivities, which lasted three days. In the northern islands only one
wife was allowed, but any number of handmaids and slaves; in the south,
where, no doubt, Islamism was not without its influence, any number of
legitimate wives was permitted: circumcision was also practised.</p>
<p>Hired mourners, as well as the members of the family, were gathered
round the corpse, and sang hymns proclaiming the virtues of the dead.
The body was washed, perfumed, dressed and sometimes embalmed. The poor
were speedily buried in the <i lang="tl">silong</i> over which their
huts were constructed. The rich were kept for several days, laid out in
a coffin made of a solid trunk, the mouth covered with gold-leaf, and
the place of sepulture any favourite spot which the deceased might have
selected; if on the bank of a river, the passage of boats was
interdicted for some time, lest the dead should interfere with the
concerns of the living, and a guard had charge of the tomb, near which
the garments, usual food and arms of the departed were placed in a
separate box&mdash;in the case of a woman, her loom and instruments of
labour. Where a chief of distinction was interred, a building was
erected, in which two goats, two deer, and two pigs were imprisoned and
a fettered slave belonging to the deceased, who was ordered to
accompany his master to the other world, and died a miserable death of
starvation. It was supposed on the third day after the interment that
the dead man visited his family: a vase of water was placed at the
door, that he might <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123</a>]</span>wash and free himself from the dirt of the
grave; a wax light was left burning through the day; mats were spread
and covered with ashes, that the footmarks of the dead might be traced;
and the door was opened at the accustomed time of meals, and a splendid
repast laid out for the expected visitor. No doubt it was disposed of
by the attendants in the same way as other costly sacrifices. The
Indians of the north put on black, those of the south white, mourning
robes.</p>

</div>
<p>In the administration of justice the elders were consulted, but
there was no code of laws, and the missionaries affirm that the
arbitrators of quarrels were generally but too well paid for their
awards. Murder committed by a slave was punished with
death&mdash;committed by a person of rank, was indemnified by payments
to the injured family. When a robbery took place, all the suspected
persons were ordered to bring a load of grass; these loads were mixed
in a heap, and if the stolen article was found it was restored to the
owner, and no inquiry made as to the bringer of the bundle in which it
was concealed. If this method failed, they flung all the suspected into
a river, and held him to be guilty who came first to the surface, on
the theory that remorse would not allow him to keep his breath. Many
are said to have been drowned in order to escape the ignominy of rising
out of the water. They sometimes placed candles of equal length in the
hands of all the accused, and he was held to be guilty whose candle
first went out. Another mode was to gather the accused round a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>light, and he towards whom the flames turned was
condemned as the criminal. Adultery was condoned for by fine to the
wronged persons.</p>
<p>Gold was used by weight as the medium of exchange, but there was no
coined or stamped currency. The largest weight was called a
<i>gael</i>, but it represented a dollar and a quarter in silver,
nearly corresponding to the Chinese ounce or tael; a <i>gael</i>
consisted of two <i>tinga</i>, a <i>tinga</i> of two
<i>sapaha</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2914src" href="#xd21e2914"
name="xd21e2914src">2</a> a <i>sapaha</i> was divided into
<i>sangraga</i>, a very small bean, which was the minimum weight.
Accounts were kept by heaps of stones of different sizes. Their
measures were the <i>dipa</i> (brace = 6 feet), the <i>dancal</i>
(palm), <i>tumuro</i> (span), <i>sangdamac</i> (breadth of the hand),
<i>sangdati</i> (breadth of the finger). Thus, as among many rude
nations (the vestiges are still to be traced in the phraseology of
civilization) every man carried with him his standard of
mensuration.</p>
<p>Time was reckoned by suns and moons, in the Philippines as in China.
In Chinese the same words designate day and sun, moon and month,
harvest and year. The morning was called &ldquo;cock-crowing,&rdquo;
the evening &ldquo;sun-leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No Indian passed another without a salutation and a bending of the
left knee. An inferior entering the house of a superior crouched down
until ordered to rise. Earrings were worn by women and sometimes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>by men; the chiefs had coloured turbans, scarlet
if they had killed an enemy, striped if they had killed seven or more.
Peace was made by the mingling blood with wine, and each drank of the
blood of the other. This was the most solemn of their oaths.</p>
<p>Chastity seems to have been unknown, though a price was always
exacted for a woman&rsquo;s favours.</p>
<p>Many Mahomedan superstitions and usages had found their way to the
interior, and among them the rite of circumcision.</p>
<p>All the Indians are born with a circular dark spot on the buttock,
of the size of a shilling; as their skins darken the mark extends,
becomes lighter in colour, and in age is scarcely distinguishable.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that the Indians were formerly in the habit of
punishing an unpopular person by a penalty which they called
<i>Cobacolo</i>, and which was inflicted on any who had misled them by
false counsels. The whole population assembled, went to the house of
the offender, every one bearing a cudgel; some surrounded the house to
prevent escape, and others entered and, by blows, drove the victim to
the balcony, from whence he was compelled to leap, and he was then
chased out of the neighbourhood, after which the house was razed to the
ground, and all that it contained destroyed. The tradition is preserved
in many popular proverbs and phrases, in which the <i>Cobacolo</i> is
used as a menace to evil-doers.</p>
<p>Among the most celebrated books on the Philippines are the
&ldquo;Cronicas Franciscanas,&rdquo; by Fr. Gaspar de S. Agustin, an
Augustine monk of Madrid, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href=
"#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>who lived forty years among the
Indians, and from whose descriptions I have made a few selections; but
there are remarkable contrarieties of opinion among different writers.
Their fields of observation are different, and natural temperament has
much to do with the judgment formed. Our friar does not give the
natives a favourable character. According to him they are generally
&ldquo;inconstant, distrustful, malicious, sleepy, idle, timid, and
fond of travelling by rivers, lakes, and seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are great consumers of fish, which are found in immense
abundance. After rains the fields and marshes and ponds are filled with
them. Fish two palms long are often pulled up from among the paddy. As
the waters dry up, the fish retreat to any muddy recess, and the
Indians catch them with their hands, or kill them with sticks.&rdquo; I
have seen many Indians fishing in the paddy grounds, and what becomes
of the fish in the times of drought, when no &ldquo;muddy
recesses&rdquo; are to be found, it is hard to say, but where there is
water fish may invariably be sought for with success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They eat three meals a day, consisting principally of rice,
the sweet potato, and a small quantity of fish or meat; the daily cost
of the whole being half a rial&rdquo; (= 3<i>d.</i> sterling).
&ldquo;As labourers they get half a rial in addition to their food.
They willingly borrow money, which they do not repay, and he who will
not encourage ingratitude must show them no favour; to exact a promise
is to ensure a falsehood. They are the ingrates described in the 36th
Psalm. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>never shut the door they have opened; they
return nothing to its place; they never do the work they have been paid
for beforehand, yet they do not fail to ask for an advance: the
carpenter must have money to buy wood; the washerman to get soap; and
they even practise their devices upon the parish priest! They have the
art of blundering about everything; they fold all garments the wrong
way; turn a shirt inside out, always present the back where the front
should be.&rdquo; The father is somewhat severe, and of my own
experience I can say there was at least about as much chance in such
matters of the Indians doing right as wrong. Alava said of the Indians
that their brains were in their hands.</p>
<p>The padre continues:&mdash;&ldquo;They are envious, ill-bred, and
impertinent. They will even ask a padre, &lsquo;Whence do you come?
where are you going?&rsquo; If you are reading a letter, they will look
over your shoulders, though not able to read themselves; and if two
people are talking in secret, the Indians will come near, though not
understanding a word.&rdquo; Grave charges these. &ldquo;They enter
houses, and even convents, without leave, and seem to make themselves
at home in a manner to excite wonderment and anger; even when the padre
is asleep, they make a great noise in trampling the floor, though in
their own houses they walk with as much care as if treading among eggs.
They use no chairs at home, but absolutely wear out those of the
convents by sitting and lounging on them, particularly in the
balconies, where they can get a look at the women.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>These extracts are as characteristic of the monk as of the Indian.
&ldquo;They care nothing for dog, cat, horse nor cow; the game-cock is
their great concern; him they visit at dawn; him they caress through
the day; they will contemplate him with eyes fixed for half an hour at
a time: the passion never decays; many of them think of nothing else.
The government patronizes cock-fights. Last year they produced 40,000
dollars&rdquo; (in 1859, 86,000 dollars); &ldquo;sad resource this for
so many tears, crimes, and punishments! What quarrels, what lawsuits,
what appeals! And in their gambling they pass the night till sunrise.
The chief of the Barangay (clan) loses the tribute-money he has
collected; his doom is the prison, or a flight to the mountains. They
hate to live in houses or convents where they would be placed beyond
even the odour of women. They take care of their own plates, and
exhibit in their dwellings some possessed before the arrival of the
Spaniards, but in convents and houses they break plates enough to ruin
their masters. This is because of their stupidity, or that they are
thinking of their beloved, or of anything but what ought to occupy
their thoughts; and if they let fall a dish, it is passed over by the
Spaniards, or they are only called &lsquo;brute! animal! savage!&rsquo;
In their own house, however, the breaking a piece of earthenware would
be followed with a good number of cane blows, and this is of more
efficacy than all Cicero&rsquo;s Philippics (<i>sic</i> in orig.) They
cannot be trusted with a sword, mirror, glass, gun, watch, nor any
delicate thing; they are sure to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>spoil it. You may confide to
them a bamboo, a stick, a piece of timber, a palm-branch, and to a few
of them a ploughshare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are bold and insolent in making unreasonable requests,
careless of the when or the how. They remind me in their petitions of
what happened to Sancho Panza in the island of Barataria, when troubled
with that impertinent and intrusive rustic Michael Turra. For their
four eggs they want a hundred dollars. I never see an Indian coming
towards me with a gift&mdash;something worthless, of course, and of no
use to himself&mdash;flowers or fruits, but I exclaim, in the words of
Laocoon to the Trojans&rdquo; (grandiloquent friar!)
&ldquo;&lsquo;Timeo Danaos dona ferentes.&rsquo; The Bishop of Troya,
Don Francisco Gines Barrientes, a most circumspect prelate, told me
that an Indian brought him a handkerchief of Guava fruit and asked him
for the loan of fifty dollars. And when the Lord Marquis de
Villasierra, Don Fernando de Valenzuela, was in the castle of Cavite,
an Indian gave him a cock, for which the Marquis ordered him to be paid
six times its value, and the Indian said he expected eighty cavans of
rice, and this, too, was in the time of scarcity, when every cavan was
worth two dollars. It matters little, however, for they are just as
well pleased when they fail as when they succeed, for they do not value
anything given them by a Spaniard, not even by a priest! In selling
they will ask thirty and accept six; they take the chance of cheating,
and, knowing the great goodness (<i lang="es">la suma bondad</i>) of
the Spanish character, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>they do not apprehend any
expression of anger in consequence of an absurd pretension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friar thus describes a negotiation between an Indian peasant and
a merchant:&mdash;&ldquo;The peasant has two or three hundredweight of
indigo for sale; he does not come alone, but with his relations,
friends, and sometimes the women, for the indigo belongs to several who
form the suite of the seller. Every offer has to be communicated to the
party, who are crouched in a circle round the negotiator; the offer
being discussed, they agree to the reduction of a dollar in the
price&mdash;the buyer requires three; this matter being settled,
another discussion begins; some of the indigo is damp and dirty, and an
allowance must be made, and thus the negotiation goes on harassing and
never-ending, so that very few Spaniards will tolerate such
impertinence and importunity, and the conference ends by a dry inquiry,
&lsquo;Will you? yes! or no!&rsquo; If no, the Indians are angrily
ordered into the street, but the more patient mestizos and Chinese make
the Indians their guests, feed them and lodge them, and get these
commodities on their own terms, in Chinese style, for the Indian is
very stupid in trading matters.&rdquo; And then the father gives
abundant evidence of their simplicity. &ldquo;In fine, the Indian
prefers the rial of a Chinese to the dollar of a Spaniard.&rdquo; Who
can wonder, then, at the prosperous condition of the Chinese in the
Philippines? &ldquo;The Indians show great indifference to danger: they
will not move out of the way of a restive horse, nor, if in a small
boat, give place to a large one. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131"
href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>In the river, if they see
crocodiles approaching, they take no notice and adopt no precautions.
The Koran says that every one has his fate written in the marks on his
forehead; so think the Indians, not that they have read the Koran, but
because of their own folly, which exposes them to daily
misfortunes.&rdquo; &ldquo;They are very credulous among themselves,
yet believe nothing but what is unfavourable about the Spaniards. It is
evident that the act of faith is supernatural when they acknowledge the
divine mysteries taught by the Spaniards. In other matters they believe
in nothing which is adverse to their interests. They do not object to
rob Spaniards, not even the ministers of religion. Of this we have
irresistible evidence, so that there can be no doubt, and we can only
regret that no remedy can be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Augustine provincial friar of Ilocos, reporting on the
insurrection of 1807 in that province, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Here, as
elsewhere, there are abundance of robbers and pilferers; it is of no
use to bring them to Manila, they should be punished in the locality;
but they can be no more extirpated than can the rats and mice. Indeed
there is an Indian proverb which says:&mdash;&lsquo;Robbers and rats
will disappear together.&rsquo;&rdquo; I cannot endorse the
friar&rsquo;s indiscriminating censures, for I have heard extraordinary
evidences of extraordinary integrity. The Alcalde of Cagayan told me
that, though he had frequently left uncounted dollars in the care of
the Indians, he had never discovered a single fraud.</p>
<p>One would suppose that the rich and potent friars <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>were
tolerably well protected against the Indians, yet one of them
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;The Indians do not now employ lances and arrows
against our ministry, but papers, pens, tales, jokes and calumnies. So
much have they been taught politics in Manila that now in all the
pueblos are obscure scribblers, pettifoggers, pretenders, who are
clever enough in writing memorials on stamped paper, to be presented to
the Royal Audiencia. So if the parish priest reprove or punish them for
their evil and scandalous lives, they meet together, drink wine, and
fill a folio paper with their crosses, and march off to Manila, to the
tribunal which they deem the most impressionable, from whence great
vexations are caused to the poor parish priest. And much courage is
required to bear this species of martyrdom, which is sufficiently
common in the Indies.&rdquo;&mdash;(Abb&eacute; Amodea.)</p>
<p>I do not know how lately there have been perquisitions against
witches, but in the middle of the last century I find the record of a
most diligent pursuit and rigorous punishment against the witches of
Pampanga. The proceedings were superintended by a friar named Theodore
of the Mother of God, who made a special report to the Mexican
Inquisition. He says:&mdash;&ldquo;There are witches in every pueblo,
and in some they form a third part of the population. These slaves of
the devil are divided into sundry classes: <i>lamias</i>, who suck the
blood of infants; <i>striges</i>, who are wanderers on the face of the
earth; <i>sagas</i>, who dwell in houses, and convey to the devil all
the information he requires; <i>larvas</i>, who devote <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>themselves to carnal delights; <i>temures</i>,
who prepare love filtres; but all unite to do mischief to the human
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the credulity of the Indians there is no end of examples. In
1832, when the <i>Santa Ana</i> arrived with 250 soldiers, a report
spread like wild-fire that the King of Spain had ordered all the
children of the Indians to be collected, that their blood might be
spilt upon the Spanish mines to make them more productive. The women
fled to their homes, seized their children, and sought an asylum in the
houses of the Spanish ladies in Manila. The men armed themselves with
spears, and rushed tumultuously through the streets. The agitation was
appeased with some difficulty. What any man reputed as a sage among the
Indians avers, acquires immediate authority, and is not to be
controlled by the influence of the priests; the words &ldquo;Vica ng
maruning,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;The wise say so,&rdquo; is the ready
answer to all impugners. &ldquo;God preserve us,&rdquo; says the friar,
&ldquo;from Indian sages! for the Indians are proud, and will not obey
the priest, nor the friar, nor the chaplain, unless obliged by fear,
and they are not always afraid, though they feel thoroughly convinced
of the superiority of the Spaniard, and are governed in spite of
themselves. They imitate the Spaniard in all that is evil&mdash;his
love of dress, his swearing habits, addiction to gaming, and all the
vicious practices of the <i lang="es">zaramullos</i> (fops or
busy-bodies); but Spanish courtesy and urbanity and good education they
neither study nor copy; but revels <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134"
href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>and drunken bouts, and
riotous weddings and burial excesses and tyrannical acts of all sorts
they have inherited from their ancestors, and still preserve, so that
they have Spanish vices added to their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They show much deference to everything that is aristocratic among
themselves. The jacket-wearing principalia are treated with great
deference, and their rank religiously respected. First, the
gobernadorcillo; then the ex-gobernadorcillos, who are called passed
captains, in order of seniority; then the acting lieutenant, who must
be the head of a barangay; then the heads of barangays according to
age; then passed lieutenants, and so on; and their rank is recognized
by the adjacent communities.</p>

alt="GIRLS BATHING." width="487" height="366">
<p class="figureHead">GIRLS BATHING.</p>
</div>
<p>Bathing is universal, men and women in the same place. The men wear
pantaloons, the women cover <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>themselves with a garment which
they throw off when they enter the water. No scandal is caused by the
habit, and several attempts of the Spanish authorities to interfere
with the ancient usage have failed.</p>
<p>The Indians embrace by touching noses; but lip-kissing often
accompanies the act. When the nostril is contracted (as in the act of
smelling), and the Indian looks towards a person at a distance, it is
deemed an invitation to a closer embrace. Strange stories are told of
the exquisite sense of smell possessed by the Indians; that by it they
can distinguish the dresses of their masters and mistresses, and lovers
ascertain the state of each other&rsquo;s affections. Inner garments
are interchanged which are supposed to be impregnated with the passions
of the owners. In disregard of the monks, the Indians secretly
circumcise their children. The banian-tree (<i>Balete</i>, <i>Ficus
Indica</i>) is held sacred. They burn incense under it, which they
obtain from the friars under various pretences. How strangely are the
rites of idolatry mingled with Christian observances! This is not the
case alone in the Philippines. One of Dr. Gutzlaff&rsquo;s renowned
converts in Hong Kong used to say that to please the missionary he had
added another god&mdash;the Christian&rsquo;s God&mdash;to those he
worshipped before; and I have known of secret visits to heathen temples
on the part of Chinese professing Christians, when they were about to
enter upon any important undertaking. &ldquo;There is no driving out of
them,&rdquo; says the padre, &ldquo;the cursed belief that the spirits
of their ancestors are in the woods and among <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>the
roots of bamboos, and that they can bring good or evil upon them. They
will offer sacrifices to them; and all our books and all our preachings
have failed to remove the impressions left by any old man whom they
choose to call &lsquo;a sage.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;The curates,&rdquo;
says De Mas, &ldquo;profess to believe that these superstitions are
passing away; no doubt the Indian conceals them as much as he can from
his father confessor, but I have on many occasions convinced myself of
their existence and influence.&rdquo; Who, indeed, knowing anything of
the credulity of the less instructed classes, and not these alone,
among ourselves, can wonder at the state of &ldquo;the religious
mind&rdquo; of the Philippine Indian? And so little are the priests
themselves wholly free from infirmity, that a Philippine curate,
Mallares, committed and caused to be committed no less than fifty-seven
assassinations in the town of Magalan, believing that he should thus
save his mother from being bewitched. Mallares was executed in 1840;
and in his report the fiscal expresses his horror of &ldquo;the
incredible and barbarous prodigality of bloodshed by this
monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian knows no medium,&rdquo; again to quote from the
father. &ldquo;Ask for tepid water, he will bring it boiling; say it is
too hot, and you will get it quite cold. He lives in a circle of
extremes. He rejoices if you lose patience and give him a beating, for
he goes and boasts of having put his master into a passion. To irritate
the Indian, you must take no notice of his short-comings. The sagacious
men among them say that the Indian and the cane (for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>his
correction) always grow together. They have another proverb: &lsquo;The
Spaniard is fire, and the Indian snow, and the snow puts out the
fire.&rsquo;&rdquo; One of the padres reports that his servant-boy said
to him: &ldquo;You are a new comer, and are too indulgent: if I do
amiss you ought to chastise me. Don&rsquo;t you know the proverb,
&lsquo;The Indian and the cane grow together?&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;They
blaspheme and abuse God when their prayers are not granted, and use
language which would indeed be horrible were it not known how
thoughtless they are, and how impossible it is for them to conform
themselves to the Divine will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are fond of religious dramas, especially of one in Tag&aacute;l
representing the passion and death of Christ; but these religious
representations and gatherings give rise to scandal and abuse, and the
birth of many illegitimate children. The priests have generally
prohibited these exhibitions at night, and sometimes disperse them,
whip in hand; at other times the singers are denounced, and get flogged
for their pains&mdash;or pleasures.</p>
<p>It is amusing to read the contradictory opinions of the friars
respecting their flocks. One says:&mdash;&ldquo;Their confessions are
false; they never own to any but three sins: first, that they have
neglected church-going; second, that they eat meat during Lent; and
third, that they have sworn profanely.&rdquo; Another
reports&mdash;&ldquo;No Spaniard can be more devout and fervid than the
Indians of Manila in their confessions. They obey the instructions they
receive, and I have the same good account from many padres of many
Indians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>in the provinces.&rdquo; No doubt the
ecclesiastical statistics would be curious, if obtainable. In Lilio,
the curate reports that of 1,300 persons paying tribute in 1840, 600
never confessed, and &ldquo;this pueblo is not of the most
remiss.&rdquo; In Vigan, of 30,000 inhabitants, the attendance at
church did not exceed from 500 to 800 (De Mas), except on the yearly
festival of the Virgin, patroness of the pueblo. Father Agustin&rsquo;s
indignation is vehemently expressed as regards
confession:&mdash;&ldquo;The infernal Macchiavel Satan has taught them
a policy as good for their bodies as bad for their souls, which is that
they own their errors and crimes to one another, and conceal them,
however excessive, from the spiritual father, from the Spanish alcalde,
notwithstanding their personal quarrels, and, as they call them,
murder-enmities; so that there is among them no greater offence than to
tell the padre or the alcalde what has happened in the pueblo, which
they say is <i>mabibig</i>, the most abominable of sins; indeed, the
only offence which they hold to be sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friars speak in general more favourably of the women than of the
men. They are more devout, more submissive, more willing to listen to
their ghostly fathers, one of whom says:&mdash;&ldquo;Did all mankind
hang upon a single peg, and that peg were wanted by an Indian for his
hat, he would sacrifice all mankind. They have no fear of death, but
this is an infinite mercy of the Divine Being, who knows how fragile
they are; they talk about death, even in the presence of the dying,
without any concern. If condemned to the scaffold, they exhibit equal
indifference, and smoke <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>their cigar with wonted
tranquillity. Their answer to the attendant priest is invariably,
&lsquo;I know I am going to die. I cannot help it. I have been
wicked&mdash;it was the will of God,&mdash;it was my fate,&rsquo; But
the approach of death neither interferes with their sleep nor their
meals.&rdquo; &ldquo;The tree must bear its fruit,&rdquo; he continues.
&ldquo;God in his wisdom has made many races of men, as He has made
many varieties of flowers, and at last I reconciled myself to seeing
the Indians do everything differently from what we should do, and
keeping this in view, I could mould them like wax to my
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a general result I have not found among these Indian races any
one distinguished for intellectual superiority. A few were not backward
in their knowledge of the mechanical arts; one or two examples there
were of genius as sculptors; a universal love and devotion to the
musical art, and some appreciation even of the merits of European
composers; but, it must be added, little or nothing is done to develop
such capacities as the Indians possess; the field of public instruction
is narrowed alike by religious and official influences, and the social
tone of the opulent classes, to which alone the Indian can look up, is
greatly below that of the Spanish peninsula. Literature is little
cultivated: the public newspapers are more occupied with the lives of
saints, and preparation for, or accounts of, religious <i lang=
"es">fiestas</i>, than with the most stirring events of the political
world. The Spaniards have never been celebrated for very busy
inquiries, or very active virtues; but it is to be hoped <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>that
the <i lang="es">ma&ntilde;ana</i>, to which everything is referred,
will at last become an <i lang="es">hoy dia</i>.</p>
<p>It has been said of the Indian that he is more of a quadruped than a
biped. His hands are large, and the toes of his feet pliant, being
exercised in climbing trees, and divers other active functions. He is
almost amphibious, passing much of his time in the water. He is
insensible alike to the burning sun and the drenching rain. The
impressions made upon him are transitory, and he retains a feeble
memory of passing or past events. Ask him his age, he will not be able
to answer: who were his ancestors? he neither knows nor cares. He
receives no favours and cannot, therefore, be ungrateful; has little
ambition, and therefore little disquiet; few wants, and hence is
neither jealous nor envious; does not concern himself with the affairs
of his neighbour, nor indeed does he pay much regard to his own. His
master vice is idleness, which is his felicity. The labour that
necessity demands he gives grudgingly. His health is generally good,
and when deranged he satisfies himself with the use of herbs, of whose
astringent or laxative powers he has had experience. He uses no soap to
wash, no razor to shave; the river is his bathing-place, and he pulls
out the hairs in his face with the assistance of a sharp shell; he
wants no clock to tell him of the flight of time&mdash;no table, nor
chairs, nor plates, nor cutlery, to assist him at his meals; a <i lang=
"es">hacha</i>, or large knife, and bag are generally hung at his
waist; he thinks no music equal to the crowing of his cock, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>holds a shoe to be as superfluous as a glove or
a neck-collar.</p>
<p>I certainly have not discovered among the Indians that enduring
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">&agrave; tout jamais</span>&rdquo; horror of
foreigners upon which M. Mallat dwells, and which he represents as
specially and properly directed against Englishmen. On the contrary, I
found many Englishmen settled in the Philippines objects of great
confidence and affection; and I have heard mestizos and Indians say
that they put greater trust in English commercial probity than in that
of any other nation. I have witnessed the cordiality with which the old
Spanish proverb, &ldquo;Paz con Ynglaterra y con todo el mundo
guerra,&rdquo; has been quoted in large assemblies of the Filipinos.
And assuredly there is no nation which has contributed more than
England to the prosperity of the Spanish archipelago. Evidence enough
will be found in the course of this narrative of the kindness shown to
Englishmen.</p>
<p>It has been said that the Spaniards have very discreetly and
successfully used the &ldquo;divide et impera&rdquo; among the Indian
races as a means of preserving their own authority. There is little
sympathy, it is true, between the remoter races; but that their
separation and aberration form a part of the Spanish policy may be
disproved by the fact that in Binondo nearly one-third of the resident
inhabitants are Indians from distant provinces.</p>
<p>The numerical power of the Spaniards is small, that of the armed
natives great, were there among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142"
href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>them a disposition to rebel
against their rulers: I believe there is little of such disposition.
Lately the Tag&aacute;l soldiers have been called into active service
in a foreign country (Cochin China), and involved in a quarrel where
the Spanish interest is not very discernible. No complaints have been
made of their conduct, though they have been exposed to much
privation.</p>
<p>There is a pretty custom among the peasantry of the interior. Little
bamboo frames are seen either supported by a post, or projecting from a
window of the choza, on which is to be found, covered with plantain
leaves, a supply of food, or fruits, provided from the Indian&rsquo;s
garden, which invariably surrounds his dwelling. Any passing traveller
supplies himself, paying nothing if he be poor, but otherwise leaving
such compensation as he may deem proper. No sort of reproach attaches
to the person who, without the means of payment, partakes of the
proffered bounty. These hospitable receptacles are most common in the
least peopled localities, and reminded me of the water and the lamp
which I have found in the tombs of sainted Mussulmans, who had
themselves discharged, or required their followers thus to discharge,
the claims of humanity, and in the arid desert provided these grateful,
silent, and touching welcomes to the thirsty and weary traveller.</p>
<p>The tact or talent of imitation is strong among the Indians, and
facilitated the efforts of the friars, but very various and
contradictory reports are found of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>their aptitudes. Those of
Pampanga, Cagayan, Pangasinan, Ilocos, and Zebu are reported to be
valiant, generous, laborious, and frequently exhibiting artistical
taste. I found the love and the practice of music universal, and saw
some remarkable specimens of sculptural ability, but of painting
nothing Indian was ever presented to my attention, and the examples of
persevering dedication to any sort of labour were few indeed. As
servants, the Tag&aacute;ls are in all respects inferior to the
Chinese; as soldiers, the officers generally reported of them
favourably. The Indians settled in Manila are said to be the worst of
their races: no doubt great cities are the recipients of the dregs of a
people, but they attract at the same time the highest order of merit.
The courtesies which we received as their guests seemed boundless; no
effort too great to do us honour: something, indeed much, could not but
be attributed to the guidance of the priests and the presence of the
authorities, but there were a thousand marks of spontaneous kindness,
such as no external influence could have commanded. <span class=

Chinese seem everywhere to preserve the same characteristics. The
British Consul-General of Borneo writes to me:&mdash;&ldquo;Chinese
settlers cannot flourish under Malay rule. We have a few hundreds, but
the country would absorb hundreds of thousands. In the interior I found
among the aborigines a lively remembrance of the former Chinese
pepper-growers; they have been all destroyed or driven away by civil
dissensions. There remain a few of their descendants, who speak the
language of their fathers, but they are not distinguishable from the
natives. A Chinese merchant was speaking disparagingly of one of the
chiefs, who turned round, and, much to the astonishment of the
Chinaman, accosted him in very tolerable Fokien. The little
pepper-growing that remains is partly conducted by the mixed races. The
produce is slightly increasing, and a few Chinese with native wives are
beginning to try it again.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">Far more than the fair portion of domestic and social
cares falls upon the Indian female, and she has far less than her
becoming share of enjoyments. Barbarous practices are frequently
associated with parturition. The <i lang="tl"><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3134" title="Source: Mabuling">Mabuting</span> hilot</i>, the
good midwife, is called in. If the birth be delayed, witches are
supposed to be the cause, and their dispersion is effected by the
explosion of gunpowder from a bamboo cane close to the head of the
sufferer. The new-born infant is laid on a mat or pillow and exposed to
the air, to facilitate the escape of evil influences from the body,
which is brought about by burning three wax tapers placed on the two
cheeks and chin of the babe, often to its great peril. These practices
are to some extent checked and controlled by the priests, who provide
where they can for the baptism and registration of the infant.</p>
<p>The patriarchal custom of serving in the house of the father in
order to obtain the hand and heart of the daughter, is by no means
abolished in the Philippines; nor is the yet more intimate intercourse
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>of plighted lovers, which is reported to be
still in usage in the ruder parts of Wales, and with the same perilous
consequences to the feebler sex. The domestication of the lover in the
house of his intended father-in-law leads to the birth of great numbers
of illegitimate children, to frequent violations of vows and promises,
to domestic quarrels and much misery. The influence of the friars is
generally employed for the protection of the frail one. They are
opposed both by duty and interest to these irregularities, matrimonial
fees being among the most productive contributions to their
revenues.</p>
<p>I find one of the priests giving the following instructions to the
Indians as to marriage:&mdash;&ldquo;It is not right,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;to marry heedlessly, nor to hurry the sacred ceremony as if it
were to be got rid of as soon as possible. Let the parties consult the
padre, who will learn if they are really disposed to marry. You Indians
say the male naturally runs after the female and obtains her consent
(an Indian proverb); but this is not decorous; the proper mode of
courting is for the priest to say, &lsquo;Will you be the spouse of
&mdash;&mdash;, according to the arrangements of our holy mother
Church?&rsquo; This is first to be asked of the woman, and then an
inquiry is to be made of the man whether he will have the woman, and
the ancient and immodest usages of past times must then be
abandoned.&rdquo; In the same spirit is the common saying of the
Indians, &ldquo;Savangmatovir ang ihinahatol nang ma&ntilde;ga
padre&rdquo; (The counsels of the padre are always right). And
again&mdash;&ldquo;There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>is no Christian road but through
the Roman Catholic Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>F. de los Santos says there is no instance of a Tag&aacute;la woman
making advances in the way of marriage, nor of a father or mother
looking out a bridegroom for their daughter; that it would be a great
affront were any girl to seek the favour of the person whom she wished
to be her mother-in-law in order to win the son. No woman was ever
heard to say, &ldquo;<span lang="tl">Manciganguin mo aco</span>&rdquo;
(Make me thy daughter-in-law).</p>
<p>The same friar asserts that the Indians have learnt the meaning
which the Europeans attach to &ldquo;horns,&rdquo; and that the
corresponding Tag&aacute;l word <i lang="tl">sungayan</i> (horned
animal) cannot be used indiscreetly without giving great offence. He is
very angry with the nonsense (<i>boberias</i> and <i lang=
"es">disparates</i>) which he says the natives address to their
children. A mother will call her babe father, and mother, and aunt, and
even king and queen, sir and madam, with other extravagant and
unbecoming outbreaks of affection, which he reproves as altogether
blameworthy and intolerable.</p>
<p>Though there is some variety in the houses of the Indians, according
to their opulence, they preserve a common character, having bamboo
floors, nipa roofs, and wooden pillars to support them. A speculation
was entered into near Manila to provide more comfortable domestic
accommodation for the natives by introducing imported improvements; but
the houses were unoccupied, and the adventure <span class=

"pb147">147</a>]</span>proved a losing one. I have seen handsome lamps
suspended from the roofs, and pictures hung upon the walls, of some of
the Indian dwellings; while among the mestizos many aspire to all the
decorations of Spanish luxury, competing with the richest among the
European settlers. But religious ornaments are never forgotten, such as
images and pictures of the Virgin and her child, vessels for holy water
and crucifixes.</p>
<p>The beds of the Indians are merely mats on which the whole family
repose indiscriminately. Here they smoke their cigars, chew their
betel, and fall asleep. The domestic utensils are &ldquo;a mortar for
grinding rice, bamboos for all purposes, cup and spoons of the
cocoa-nut shell, pots and kettles, a knife called a <i lang=
"tl">goloc</i>, a bench against the wall, a stool which serves for a
table, a Chinese basin for oil, a clay lamp, some cotton wicks, torches
of the resin-cane, an image of the Virgin, a crucifix, mats, a jar of
betel leaves, some areca nuts and lime ready for use, and sometimes a
flute or guitar.&rdquo;&mdash;(Buzeta.)</p>
<p>The Indians have a very vague idea of distance. <i>Tahanan</i> and
<i>Bita&ntilde;gan</i> are the names given to places of rest between
different localities. Instead of the Spanish word league, they say
&ldquo;taval,&rdquo; which is the distance an ordinary burthen can be
carried without stoppage.</p>
<p>The forty days&rsquo; labour which is exacted every year from the
Indians is called <i>atag</i> or <i>bayani</i>. This is in addition to
the <i lang="es">tributo</i> of a dollar and one-third; but exemption
from the <i>atag</i> may be obtained by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>the payment of three
dollars. The tribute is called <i>bovis</i> or <i>buvis</i>.
&ldquo;<span lang="tl">Buvis aco sa bala&ntilde;gay ni
covan</span>&rsquo; (I am tributary to such and such a balangay).</p>
<p>A curious illustration of the passion for gaming, so general among
the Filipinos, is given by the statistical commission, in the report on
Binondo. Among the not prohibited games is that called by the natives
<i lang="tl">Panguingui</i>. It is played with six packs of cards, and
five or six persons make a party. This game is most popular among all
classes. The authorities prohibit its being played during the hours of
labour, but it is permitted from twelve to two <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span>, and from sunset to ten <span class="sc">P.M.</span>,
on ordinary days, and there is no restriction on festival days. The
commission determined to visit without notice the different tables
where the game was played; they found on an average 200 tables
occupied, but there were 39 ready for play unoccupied.</p>

<p>This did not include the tables in private houses, to which the
commission had no access. It is to be presumed that these visits took
place during the authorised hour of play, but this is not stated by the
commission.</p>
<p>Though games of hazard are prohibited to the multitude, the great
game of the lottery is monthly played for the profit of the government
and the perdition of the people. Its existence and its temptations
encourage that gambling passion which is one of the greatest plagues of
the Filipinos. The newspapers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149"
href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>are constantly occupied with
long lists of persons condemned to heavy fines and imprisonments for
indulging in what may be called the besetting sin of the Indians, from
which, however, neither mestizos, Chinese nor Europeans are by any
means free.</p>
<p>But the passion for play is most strikingly and universally
exhibited in the cock-fights, so characteristic that I can scarcely
avoid entering upon some details.</p>
<p>A writer on the Philippines, after showing the antiquity of
cock-fighting, and tracing its history through most of the civilized
nations of the world, thus concludes:&mdash;&ldquo;In Spain there is a
notable affection for cock-fights, and great is the care with which the
birds are trained to the combat. In America this amusement is a
dominant passion, and the Filipinos are not a whit behind the
Americans. Nay, here the passion is a delirium, and no law can check
the number or the duration of the fights, accompanied by slaughter of
the combatants, which may be well called perfidious&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>
in violation of protecting regulations). &ldquo;In other places they
sharpen the spurs of the cocks. In the Philippines they are armed with
razors, and chance more than skill decides the contest. Every day
countless numbers perish, but the race is not diminished. There is
hardly a locality which has not more cocks than human inhabitants. On
the Puente Grande of Manila, at between four and five <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span>, hundreds and hundreds of &lsquo;the shrill
clarions&rsquo; are heard on all sides, and from vast distances; it is
a string of signals passed from mouth to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>mouth, from the port
of Bangui, in North Ilocos, to Manog, the southernmost point of Albay.
There are cocks in every house, at every corner, at the foot of every
tree, along the quays and shores, on the prows of every coasting ship,
and, as if the living were not enough, they are sculptured, they are
painted and charcoaled (not artistically) on every wall for public
admiration, and public admiration recognizes the portraiture, though
the information is not placed there&mdash;as by the painter of
old&mdash;to announce, &lsquo;This is a cock.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is a translation of an advertisement from a Manila
newspaper:&mdash;&rdquo;<i>Principal Cock-fight of Tondo</i>.&mdash;The
subscriber informs the public that on all cock-fighting days a great
crowd from all parts, nearly half of them Chinese, attend, so that on a
single day there are from 90 to 100 combats, and this not only from the
convenience of the place, which is made of tiles, but because the
doubloons (<i lang="es">onzas</i>) which circulate there are honest
doubloons (<i lang="es">son de recibo</i>).&mdash;Dalmacio
Oligario.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is considered a discourtesy to touch an Indian&rsquo;s game-cock,
and permission is always asked to examine a favourite bird. He is the
object of many a caress; he eats, crows, and sleeps in the arms of his
master; and, whatever else may be forgotten, the cock is in continual
remembrance. I have found him celebrated in verse in terms the most
affectionate. A cock that has been frequently victorious is subjected
to the most minute criticism, in order to discover by external marks
what may serve to <span class="corr" id="xd21e3275" title=
"Source: characterise">characterize</span> his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>merits. The scales of his legs are counted,
their form and distribution, the bent of the rings on the spurs, and
whether the two spurs resemble each other; the shape of the toes and
their nails, the number and colours of the wing-feathers (eleven being
the favourite quantity); white eyes are preferred to chesnut; a short
comb falling over the eye and beak is a recommendation. Cocks of
different colours bear different names&mdash;white, <i lang=
"tl">puti</i>; red, <i lang="tl">pula</i>; white with black spots,
<i lang="tl">talisain</i>; red body and black tail and wings, <i lang=
"tl">bulic</i> or <i lang="tl">taguiguin</i>; black, <i lang=
"tl">casilien</i>, or <i lang="tl"><span class="corr" id="xd21e3300"
title="Source: mactin">maitin</span></i>; black and white, <i lang=
"tl">binabay</i>; ash-colour, <i lang="tl">abuen</i>; black and white,
having black legs, <i lang="tl">tagaguin</i>; and many others. The wild
cock is called <i lang="tl">labuyo</i>.</p>
<p>Of cock-fighting I translate Buzeta&rsquo;s
description:&mdash;&ldquo;The Indians have an inveterate passion for
the sport, which occupies the first place in their amusements. The cock
is the first object of their care, their general companion, which
accompanies them even to the church-door, and is fastened to a bamboo
plug outside, when they enter for the service of the mass. For no money
will they dispose of a favourite bird. Some possess as many as
half-a-dozen of these inappreciable treasures, for whose service they
seem principally to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every pueblo has its <i lang="es">gallera</i>, or
amphitheatre, for the cock-fights, from which the government draws a
considerable revenue. The galleras are large buildings constructed of
palm-trunks, bamboo, and nipa leaves, consisting of a hall, lighted
from windows in the roof. In the centre is a stage, raised about five
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>feet high, surrounded by bamboo galleries, which
are reached by the spectators, who pay according to the adjacency and
convenience of the seats. The gallera is generally crowded. The Indian
enters with his cock under his arm; he caresses the favourite, places
him on the ground, lifts him up again, smooths his feathers, talks to
him, blows his cigar-smoke over him, and, pressing him to his breast,
tells him to fight bravely. The cock generally crows aloud in defiance
and in pride. His rival appears, a sharpened spur, or rather two-edged
knife, or razor, is fastened to the natural spur of the bird, and after
being for some time presented to each other the sign of combat is
given, which is carried on with extraordinary excitement, until an
alguacil announces that the betting is closed. The announcement is
followed by universal silence. The owners of the cocks withdraw at
another signal, and the combatants contemplate each other, their
feathers agitated and erect; they bend their necks, shake their heads,
and spring upon one another; the fight continues until one is mortally
wounded and falls. The conqueror springs upon him, and crows in token
of victory; but it is not unusual for the wounded cock to rise and turn
upon his victor. If the victor should fly (as is sometimes the case),
he is condemned to ignominious death; his feathers are plucked, and he
is suspended almost naked on the outside of the gallera. The wounds of
the living bird are staunched by an infusion of tobacco leaves in
cocoa-nut wine. He becomes from that hour a favourite to be betted on,
and if disabled for future <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>frays, he is carefully provided
for by his master. There are cock-doctors and receiving-houses devoted
to the healing of their wounds.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3327width" id="p152"><img src="images/p152.jpg"
alt="GALLERA, OR COCK-PIT." width="444" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">GALLERA, OR COCK-PIT.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the neighbourhood of the gallera are stalls, where wines,
sweetmeats, chocolate, and other refreshments, are sold, prepared by
Indians and Chinese. A whole day is devoted to the combat, and even the
charms of the <i lang="es">siesta</i> are forgotten, and the Indian
often returns to his home after sunset a wretched and a ruined
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indians were sometimes desirous that we should witness the
exhibition, and brought their favourite cocks to be admired; but I had
little curiosity to witness such a display, picturesque as it was no
doubt&mdash;more picturesque than humane.</p>
<p>Don Ildefonso de Aragon passes this severe judgment upon the
sport:&mdash;&ldquo;Perpetual idlers,&rdquo; the Indians, &ldquo;they
go from cockpit to cockpit, those universities of every vice, which the
owners think themselves privileged to keep constantly open and
accessible; hence they come forth consummate masters of roguery,
jugglery, frauds, ready for acts of violence in private and in public,
in town and in country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kite-flying (introduced by the Chinese, among whom it is an
amusement both for young and old, and who have made their kites musical
by day and illuminated by night) is popular in the Philippines, as are
fire-balloons and other pyrotechnic displays.</p>
<p>Except on suitable occasions, the Indian is sober and economical,
but he makes great efforts at display when desirous of honouring his
guests. On two or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154"
name="pb154">154</a>]</span>three occasions we sat down to meals, which
a gastronomer would scarcely have ventured to criticise; a variety of
wines, health-drinking, and even speech-making, music and firing of
guns, accompanying the festivity. Smoking never fails to form a part of
the entertainment; pure cigars of various sizes, and paper cigarritos,
being always at hand. St. Andrew&rsquo;s day, kept in celebration of
the delivery of the Philippines from piratical Chinese, is one of great
rejoicing.</p>
<p>In religious ceremonies the Indian takes a busy part, and lends a
very active co-operation. When they take place after sunset, crowds
attend with burning tapers. Gun-firing, music and illuminations are the
general accompaniments of the great <i lang="es">fiestas</i>. I have
more than once mentioned the universality of the musical passion, which
is easily trained to excellent performances. An Indian, we heard, was
not selected to the band unless he could play for eight hours without
cessation. The national music of Spain is generally studied, and, in
honour to us, in some places they learnt our &ldquo;God save the
Queen!&rdquo; We were not hypercritical upon the first attempts, but
such tributes from a race, that only sought to do our sovereign, our
country, and ourselves all honour, could not but greatly gratify
us.</p>
<p>When at Guimbal (Iloilo), we were waited on at table wholly by
Indian female children, prettily dressed; whose bright eyes expressed
extreme curiosity, and whose anxiety to understand and to administer to
every wish was very charming. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>were much pleased to exhibit
the various garments they wore of the pi&ntilde;a cloth. I remarked one
who went to the friar, and whispered in his ear, &ldquo;But where are
the golden garments of the general?&rdquo; meaning me, and the padre
had to explain to the children that &ldquo;golden garments&rdquo; were
only worn on State occasions, which did not seem satisfactory, as the
occasion of our arrival in the pueblo was one of unprecedented
excitement and display. They crowded round me, however, and looked into
my face, and expressed admiration at my long soft hair. Their
associating finery with rank reminded me of a visit once paid me by a
young Abyssinian prince, who was taken up the narrow staircase by some
mistake of the servants, and who (his interpreter told me) afterwards
said to him, &ldquo;You told me I was to see a great man&mdash;had ever
a great man so small a staircase?&rdquo; At his next visit, he was
conducted through the principal portals up the wide marble steps of the
house in which I lived, and he expressed extreme satisfaction, and
said, &ldquo;Ah! this is as it should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few of the Indians reach the dignity of the priesthood, but they
are generally <i lang="es">asistentes</i> to the friars. I have heard
from the lips of Indian priests as pure Castilian as that spoken in
Madrid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have observed,&rdquo; says Father Diaz, &ldquo;that the
word of an Indian is more to be trusted when he uses one of the ancient
forms of speech, such as &lsquo;<i lang="tl">totoo nang
totoo</i>&rsquo; (it is as true as truth, or, it is truly true), than
when called on to take a solemn oath in the name of God or of the
cross.&rdquo; A youth always seeks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156"
href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>to get the promise of his
sweetheart made according to the old Tag&aacute;l usage, and it is held
as the best security of veracity in all the relations of life.</p>
<p>Many of the padres complain that, notwithstanding all the religious
instruction given, the taint of idolatry still exists among the
converted Indians. There is a sort of worship of ancestors which is
seen in many forms. They attach to the word <i lang="tl">nono</i>
(forefather) the same spiritual meaning which the Chinese give to
<i>Kwei</i>. These nonos are often addressed in prayer, in order to
bring down blessings or to avert calamities. If an Indian gather a
flower or fruit, he silently asks leave of the nono. Certain spots,
woods and rivers, he never passes without an invocation to these
departed genii. Pardon is asked for short-comings or actions of
doubtful character. There is a disease called <i>pamoao</i> which is
attributed to the influence of the nonos, to whom petitions and
sacrifices are offered to obtain relief. These idolatries, says one of
the friars, are so deeply rooted and so widely spread as to demand the
utmost vigilance for their extirpation.</p>
<p>So, again, they have their native devil, in the shape of a little
black old man, a wild horse, or monster. As a protection against this
fiend, however, they apply to their rosary, which certainly affords
evidence that <i>he</i> is an orthodox demon of whom the padres cannot
fairly complain.</p>
<p>Witches and witchery are called in to discover thieves and to
unbewitch bewitched persons; but scapularies and saints, especially St.
Anthony of Padua, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157"
name="pb157">157</a>]</span>are auxiliaries in undoing the mischiefs
menaced or done. The cauldrons of the weird sisters in <i>Macbeth</i>
would find counterparts among the people of the Philippine Islands, but
there must be a mingling of Christian texts and Catholic superstitions
to complete the identity. One author says these incantations are used
for the attainment of riches, beautiful wives, success in battle,
escape from justice, and other objects of desire. Father Ortiz will
have it that the secrets of these supernatural influences are treasured
up in various manuscript works &ldquo;which ought to be burned.&rdquo;
Their preservation and publication (if they exist) would be more
serviceable, because more instructive, to mankind.</p>
<p>Indian women are seldom seen without some religious ornaments. They
have rosaries of corals or pearl beads, medals of copper or gold,
having figures of Our Lady of Mexico or Guadalupe. The scapulary is
generally found hanging by the rosary. Many of the Indians are
associated in the Cofradias, whose different emblems they preserve with
great veneration; such as St. Augustine&rsquo;s string, St.
Francis&rsquo; cord, St. Thomas&rsquo;s belt; but they also hang upon
their children&rsquo;s necks crocodiles&rsquo; teeth as a preservative
against disease.</p>
<p>The ancient Indian name for God was <i lang="tl">Bathala</i>, to
whom they attributed the creation of the world. Remnants of the old
idolatry remain among the people, and the names of some of the idols
are preserved. A few phrases are still retained, especially in the
remoter parts, as, for example, &ldquo;<span lang="tl">Magpabathala
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>ca</span>&rdquo; (Let the will of Bathala be
done), and the priests have been generally willing to recognize the
name as not objectionable in substitution for <i lang="es">Dios</i>.
The Tag&aacute;l word adopted for idolatry is <i lang=
"tl">Pagaanito</i>, but to the worship of images they give the term
<i lang="tl">Anito</i>. I find among the records reference to an idol
called <i lang="tl">Lacambui</i>, probably the god of eating, as the
Spaniards call him <i lang="es">Abogado de la Garganta</i> (the
throat-advocate). The idol <i lang="tl">Lacanpate</i> was the god of
the harvest, and was equally male and female; &ldquo;an hermaphrodite
devil,&rdquo; he is called by one of the friars. <i>Linga</i> was the
god who cured diseases. <i lang="tl">Lachan bacor</i> protected the
growing crops. <i lang="tl">Aman Sinaya</i> was the fisherman&rsquo;s
god, and was appealed to when the nets were cast. <i lang="tl">Ama ni
Caable</i> was the protector of huntsmen. An ill-famed idol named
<i lang="tl">Tumano</i> was believed to wander about at night among
human habitations; the Indians threw ashes upon him, and calling out,
&ldquo;Iri, iri,&rdquo; he fled, being &ldquo;a cowardly devil.&rdquo;
<i lang="tl">Mancucutor</i> was the patron of a particular class of
Indians, but the traditions are very obscure.</p>
<p>There is a bird called by the natives <i lang=
"tl">Tigmamanoquin</i>, and if, when they are going to a festival, this
bird flies from the right to the left, it is considered of auspicious
augury, but disastrous if it fly from the left to the right. The bird
(I know not its classical name) is never killed by the Indians, but if
caught it is set free with the words, &ldquo;<span lang=
"tl"><span class="corr" id="xd21e3448" title=
"Source: Kayona">Hayona</span> tigmamanoquin, lunchan mo nang
halinging</span>&rdquo; (Be gone, bird! and sing sweetly for me).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Indians believe that a guardian angel is born at the birth of
every Christian child, to whose special care through life the infant is
confided. In some parts this angel is called <i lang="tl">Catotobo</i>,
in others <i lang="tl">Tagatanor</i>. But the Tag&aacute;ls habitually
employ the Castilian words <i lang="es">angel</i> and <i lang=
"es">angeles</i> in the Catholic sense. I remember to have heard a
clever Dutchman say that Java was well governed by knowing how to use
properly two Arabic words&mdash;<i>Islam</i> (faith), which was never
to be interfered with; and <i>Kismet</i> (fate), under whose influence
Mussulmans cheerfully submit to their destiny. The <i lang="es">Santa
Iglesia madre</i> is the charm by which the Philippines are ruled.</p>
<p>The Indian women are generally cleanly in their persons, using the
bath very frequently, and constantly cleaning and brightening their
black and abundant hair, which they are fond of perfuming and tying in
a knot behind, called the <i lang="tl">pus&oacute;d</i>, which is kept
together by a small comb and gilded needles, and is adorned with a
fragrant flower. They are proud of their small foot, which the Chinese
call golden lily, and which has a slipper, often embroidered with gold
or silver, just supported by the toes. Their walk is graceful and
somewhat coquettish; they smoke, eat betel, and are rather given to
display a languid, liquid eye, for which they have an Indian
expression, &ldquo;<span lang="tl">Mapu&ntilde;gay na
mata</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dress of the Filipinos is simple enough. It consists of a shirt
worn outside a pair of pantaloons; but the shirt is sometimes of
considerable value, woven of the pi&ntilde;a, handsomely embroidered,
and of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>various colours, bright red being predominant. I
asked an opulent Indian to show me his wardrobe, and he brought out
twenty-five shirts, exhibiting them with great pride; there were among
them some which may have been worth a hundred dollars each. It is
difficult to fix a limit to the money value of the more exquisite
specimens of weaving and embroidery. A small pocket handkerchief sent
to the Queen of Spain is said to have cost five hundred dollars. One or
two doubloons (<i lang="es">onzas</i>) of gold are asked for the
<i lang="es">pa&ntilde;uelos</i> (kerchiefs) usually sold in the shops
of the capital. The finest qualities are woven in the neighbourhood of
Iloilo. The loom is of the rudest and simplest construction; one woman
throws the shuttle, another looks after the threads. The cloth is sent
to Manila to be embroidered. The women wear gowns of the fabrics of the
country, into which, of late, the silks of China and the coloured yarns
of Lancashire have been introduced. The better-conditioned wear an
embroidered shawl or kerchief of pi&ntilde;a. This is the
representative of female vanity or ambition. When we passed through the
towns and villages of the interior, a handsomely adorned pi&ntilde;a
handkerchief was the flag that often welcomed us from the windows of
the native huts, and sometimes the children bore them about and waved
them before us in the processions with which they were wont to show
their pleasure at our presence.</p>
<p>The dress of the Indians is nearly the same throughout the islands;
the pantaloons of cotton or silk, white or striped with various
colours, girded round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>the waist with a kerchief, whose
folds serve for pockets, and a shirt over the pantaloons of cotton.
Sinamay (a native cloth), or pi&ntilde;a for the more opulent, is
universally employed. Straw hat or kerchief round the head; but the
favourite covering is a huge circular cap like a large inverted
punch-bowl, made generally of bamboo, but sometimes of tortoise-shell,
and having a metal spike or other ornament at the top; it is fitted to
the head by an internal frame, and fastened by a ribbon under the chin.
This <i lang="tl">salacot</i> is used by many as a protection against
sun and rain; it appeared to me too heavy to be convenient.</p>
<p>Among the Indian women the opulent wear costly embroidered garments
of pi&ntilde;a, and many of them possess valuable jewels, and are
decorated on occasions of festivity with earrings, necklaces and
bracelets of pearls, diamonds and other precious stones. A few of them
speak Spanish, and during our visits became the interpreters for the
others, as the Indian women generally took a part in the graceful but
simple ceremonials which marked our progress; sometimes forming a line
through the towns and villages, and waving many-coloured flags over us
as we passed, escorted by the native bands of music. In some families
the garments which were worn a century ago are still preserved. Many of
the petty authorities are the hereditary possessors of local rank, and
on grand occasions make displays of the costumes of their forefathers.
There is some variety in the mode of dressing the hair. The
Tag&aacute;las clean it with lemon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>juice, and employ cocoa-nut
oil made fragrant by infusions of odoriferous flowers. They clean their
hands with pumice-stone. In many parts the thumbnail of the right hand
is allowed by both sexes to grow to a great length, which assists
playing on the guitar, and divers domestic operations. The under
garments of the women are tightened at the waist, and their <i lang=
"es">camisas</i> have long and wide sleeves, which are turned back upon
the arms, and embroidered in more or less costly taste. They all chew
the areca, and, as age advances, they blacken their eyebrows and wear
false hair like their patrician mistresses. They sometimes paint their
nails with vermilion, and to be entitled a <i lang="es">Castila</i>,
which means European, is recognized as a great compliment.</p>
<p>Rice is the ordinary food of the Indians. It is boiled for half an
hour, and then called <i lang="tl">canin</i>. The capsicum, or chile,
is used for a condiment. They eat three meals a day, out of a large
dish, helping themselves with their fingers, and sometimes using a
plantain leaf for a plate. They also have sauces round the central
dish, into which they dip the canin. They introduce the thumb first
into the mouth, and very dexterously employ the fingers to push forward
the food. The luxuries of the native are pretty nearly reduced to the
cigar and the betel-nut. Indeed these can scarcely be called luxuries;
they are more necessary to him than his simple food, which consists
generally of boiled rice, sometimes flavoured with fish or vegetables,
and his sweetmeat the sugar-cane. As he obtains his cigarritos at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>estanco for less than two cuertos a dozen, and
can make them, or buy them from a contrabandista, at not even half that
price, and as the cost of the areca is extremely small, his wants and
his enjoyments are easily and cheaply supplied. His garments are few
and economical, and such as in most parts of the islands are supplied
by the rude family loom; but the source of his ruin is in his <i lang=
"es">gallo</i> and his passion for play, to which nine-tenths of the
miseries of the Indian are to be traced. Out of his embarrassments the
Chinaman makes his profit, buying the labour of the indebted and
extorting its maximum with coarse and often cruel tyranny. The Chinese
have a proverb that the Indian must be led with rice in the left hand
of his master and a bamboo in the right.</p>
<p>There is in some of the islands abundance of deer and wild boars;
they are killed by arrows of two kinds&mdash;one barbed with a clove
from the wild palm, shot direct; another with an iron head, shot
upwards and falling down upon the animal. The Indians make a dry
venison (called <i>tapa</i>) of the flesh and send it to the Manila
market. Much wild fowl is found in the forest, especially of the
gallinaceous species. The Bisayan caves are frequented by the swallows
which produce the edible bird&rsquo;s-nests, and which are collected by
the natives for exportation to China.</p>
<p>Multitudes of Indians get their living by the fisheries. The fish
most esteemed is the <i>sabalo</i>, which is only found in the Taal
Lake, whose water is fresh <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=
"#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>and flows into the sea. In the
centre of the lake is an island, with its always burning volcano. At
the season when the sabalo quit the lake for the sea, an estocade of
bamboos is erected across the river, the top of which does not reach
the surface of the water; three or four yards below, another estocade
is placed, raised five or six feet above the surface, and the two
estocades are united by a bamboo platform. The fish leap over the first
barrier, and fall on the platform, where they are caught: some of them
are as large as salmon. The <i>Bay</i> Lake is celebrated for the
<i>curbina</i>, an excellent fish. By the banks of the river enormous
nets are seen, which are sunk and raised by a machinery of bamboo, and
the devices employed for the capture of fish are various and singular.
In the Bisayans the Indians make faggots, which they kindle, and,
walking on the banks with a spear in their right hand, the fish
approach the light and are harpooned and flung upon the shore. I
understand the sea-slug, which the Indians call <i>balate</i>, is thus
captured. It is a well-known delicacy among the Chinese. Turtle are
caught by watching their approach (the watcher being concealed) and
simply turning them on their backs when they are at a certain distance
from the water. Native divers bring up the mother-of-pearl oyster, but
the pearl fishery is not of much importance. These divers also discover
the enormous shell-fish which serve as receptacles for holy water in
the churches.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though the far greater number of the <i>pagan
Indians</i>, as they are called by the Spaniards, belong to the same
races as those who inhabit the towns, there are many exceptional cases.
Independent and separated from the pagans, there are numerous
Mahomedans, especially in the island of Mindanao, of which only a small
tract along the coast has been subjected by the Spaniards; these, whom
the Spaniards designate as <i>Moros</i>, a name to which traditional
and national associations attach great abhorrence, are probably of
Malayan descent. There, as in every region where missionaries have
sought to undermine or depreciate the authority of the Koran, the
attempt has wholly failed. I saw some of these people at Zamboanga, and
found them familiar with the Arabic formula of Islamism, and that many
of their names, such as Abdallah, Fatima, and others, were such as are
common to the Mussulmans. They are understood to be in amity with the
Spaniards, who have treaties with the reigning Sultan; but I found no
evidence of their recognition of Spanish authority.</p>
<p>The enmity between the Mahomedan races (<i>Moros</i>) and the
Spaniards may be deemed hereditary. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>answer given by the
Rajah Soliman of Tondo to Legaspi, the first governor of the
Philippines, who solicited his friendship, is
characteristic:&mdash;&ldquo;Not until the sun is cut in two, not until
I seek the hatred instead of the love of woman, will I be the friend of
a Castila&rdquo; (Spaniard).</p>
<p>Living in the remotest mountainous regions of Mindanao, never, I
believe, explored by European adventurers, there is a race in the very
lowest stages of barbarism, I cannot say of civilization, for of that
they present no trace. They are said to wear no garments, to build no
houses, to dress no food. They wander in the forest, whose wild fruits
they gather by day, and sleep among the branches of the trees by night.
They have no form of government, no chief, no religious rites or
usages. I saw one of the race who was brought for sale as any wild
animal might have been to the governor of Zamboanga. He refused to
purchase, but retained the lad, who was apparently of about eight or
nine years of age. At Iloilo, he was waiting, with other native
servants, at table, and he appeared to me the most sprightly and
intelligent of the whole&mdash;bright-eyed, and watching eagerly every
sign and mandate of his master. He was very dark-coloured, almost
black; his hair disposed to be woolly; he had neither the high cheeks
nor the thick lips of the African negro, but resembled many specimens I
have seen of the Madagascar people. I was informed that the whole
tribe&mdash;but the word is not appropriate, for they are not
gregarious&mdash;are of very small stature; that they avoid all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>intercourse with other races, collect nothing,
barter nothing, and, in fact, want nothing. I had once occasion to
examine in the prison of Kandy (Ceylon) one of the real &ldquo;wild men
of the woods&rdquo; of that island, who had been convicted for murder;
the moral sense was so unawakened, that it was obvious no idea of wrong
was associated with the act, and the judge most properly did not
consider, him a responsible being on whom he could inflict the
penalties of the law. There was little resemblance between the Filipino
and the Cingalese in any external characteristic. Ethnological science
would be greatly advanced if directed to the special study of the
barbarous aboriginal races of whom specimens yet remain, but of which
so many have wholly disappeared, who can have had no intercourse with
each other. I believe there are more varieties of the human family than
have hitherto been recognized by physiologists, amongst whom <i>no</i>
affinity of language will be found. The theories current as to the
derivation of the many varieties of the human race from a few primitive
types will not bear examination. Civilization and education will modify
the character of the skull, and the differences between the crania of
the same people are so great as to defy any general law of
classification. The farther back we are enabled to go, the greater will
be the distinction of types and tongues; and it will be seen that the
progress of time and commerce and knowledge and colonization, has
annihilated many an independent idiom, as it has destroyed many an
aboriginal race. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168"
name="pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>Against the wilder savages who inhabit the forests and mountains of
the interior, expeditions are not unfrequently directed by the
government, especially when there has been any molestation to the
native Christian population. Their chiefs are subjected to various
punishments, and possession is taken of their villages and strongholds;
but these are not always permanently held, from the insufficiency of
military force to retain them. But it is clear that these rude tribes
must ultimately be extinguished by the extension of cultivation and the
pressure of a higher civilization.</p>
<p>De Mas lays down as a principle that the <i>Igorrotes</i> of Luzon
are heathens of the same race as the converted Indians, but in a savage
state. The <i>Aetas</i>, or <i>Negritos</i>, are a separate race, not
indigenous, but the descendants of invaders and conquerors. He had many
opportunities of intercourse with them, and speaks favourably of his
reception among them. The men had no other covering than a belt of bark
fibres, the women a sort of petticoat of the same texture. Unmarried
girls wore a species of collar made from the leaves of a mountain palm,
whose ends met between their naked breasts. The females played on a
rude guitar, the case being a piece of bamboo, with three strings from
the roots of a tree, and which they tuned by tightening or loosening
with their left hand. When it rained, they covered themselves with
large palm-leaves, which they also used as shelter from the sun. He
says they resisted all attempts upon their chastity. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>They
brought wax, honey and deer, and sought for tobacco and rice in
exchange. For money they cared not. The mode of showing respect is to
offer water to the superior&mdash;no son can accept it from, but must
hand it to, his father. They exhibit much fear of the evil spirits that
are in the forests, but all information they gave was at secondhand.
They had not seen the spirits, but others had, and there was no doubt
about <i>that</i>. The friars report them to be short lived&mdash;their
age seldom exceeding forty years. Father Mozo says: &ldquo;They have
their localities, in which they group themselves and which they
unwillingly leave: fixed abodes they have none, but shift from place to
place within a circumference of four to five leagues. They drive four
rough sticks into the ground, surround them with the flexible branches
of the <i>ylib</i>, fling down some palm-leaves, bring in a piece of
wood for a pillow, and have their house and bed ready. The game killed
by one belongs to all&mdash;the head and neck being thrown to the dogs.
The community ordinarily consists of twenty to twenty-five persons, who
select the most courageous of their number as chief. In the summer they
locate themselves on the banks of rivers, but during the rainy and
windy seasons they confine themselves to their rude huts. If a death
take place, they bury the corpse, but flee from the locality, lest
others be summoned away. When they seek wild honey in the woods, the
finder of a swarm marks the tree where the bees are, and the property
is deemed his own until he has time to return and remove the comb. A
fire is lighted at the foot of the tree&mdash;the smoke drives away the
bees&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>the Indian mounts, bearing a broad palm-leaf
folded in the shape of a vase, into which he turns the honey-comb, ties
it over, and descends. All his wants are supplied when, in addition to
his matches for fire, his bow and arrows, and his rude cutlass, he has
a small supply of tobacco for his luxury. If food be scarce, he drinks
hot water and ties a cord tightly round his body; he eats also of a
root called <i>sucbao</i>, but in the warm weather indigenous fruits
are never wanting.&rdquo; After a string of quotations from the
classics, illustrating the pains, penalties and passions of civilized
existence, with the serenity, stupidity and satisfaction of these
children of nature, the padre says: &ldquo;Finally, in admiration of
their manner of life, if they were but enlightened by our holy
faith&mdash;if they only suffered what they suffer for the sake of
God&mdash;I verily believe they would not be paralleled by the
austerest monk of the Theba&iuml;d. True it is they commit the sin of
divorce&mdash;true it is that a slip before marriage is seldom heard
of; but they are cruel, they are murderers!&rdquo; Such is the
consistency of ecclesiastical judgment.</p>
<p>There are many speculations as to the origin of the darker, or black
races, who now occupy the northern and central mountainous and little
visited regions, and from whom one of the islands, <i>Negros</i>, takes
its name. They principally dwell in the wilder part of the provinces of
Ilocos South, Pangasinan, Cagayan, and Nueva Ecija. They are of small
stature, have somewhat flattened noses, curled hair, are agile, have no
other dress than a covering of bark over their genitals, are dexterous
hunters, have no fixed dwellings, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>sleep wherever sunset
finds them. Their whole property consists of their bow, a bamboo quiver
and arrows, a strip of skin of the wild boar, and the girdle, which the
Spaniards call the <i lang="es">tapa rabo</i> (tail cover). The
<i>Negritos</i> are held to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the
islands, which were invaded by those now called <i>Indios</i>, who much
resemble, though they are a great improvement on, the Malayan race. The
Negritos retired into the wilder districts as the Tag&aacute;ls
advanced, but between the two races there exists a great intensity of
hatred. The Negritos are the savages of the Philippines, and are
divided into many tribes, and it is said every grade between
cannibalism and the civilization of the Indian is found among them.
They generally live on the wild fruits and vegetables which grow
spontaneously, though some cultivate rice, and attend to the irrigation
of their fields. Some make iron weapons, and the <i>Itaneg</i>,
according to the friars, only want conversion to be in all respects
equal to the Indios. This race has a mixture of Chinese blood, the
<i>Ifugaos</i> of that of the Japanese. The ruder savages ornament
their cabins with the skulls of their enemies. The <i>Apayos</i> live
in comfortable houses, and employ for floors polished planks instead of
the interwoven bamboos of the Tag&aacute;ls. They carry on a trade in
wax, cocoa and tobacco, and deck their dwellings with China
earthenware. The <i>Isinay</i> Negritos profess Christianity. In the
island of Luzon there are estimated to be 200,000 heathens, in that of
Mindanao 800,000 idolators and Mussulmans. But it is impossible to
follow out the mixed races in all their ramifications and
peculiarities. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>Among the characteristics of the wilder races is
the separation of the toes, which enables them to pick up even minute
objects, so if they let anything fall they use foot or hand with equal
facility; they will descend head downwards the rigging of a ship,
holding on with their feet; the great toe is much more separated from
the others than in the white races. Their sense of smelling is
exquisite, and they profess, without the aid of language, to discover
the state of the affections from the breath.</p>
<p>Though they have a pantheon of gods and goddesses (for most of their
divinities have wives), they have no temples, and no rites of public
worship. They consult soothsayers (usually old women) in their diseases
and difficulties; and there are sacrifices, outpouring and mingling of
blood, libations of fermented liquors, violent gesticulations, and
invocations to <i>Cambunian</i> (God), the moon, and the stars, and the
ceremonials end with eating and drinking to excess. They sacrifice a
pig to pacify the Deity when it thunders, and adore the rainbow after
the storm. Before a journey they kindle a fire, and if the smoke do not
blow in the direction they intend to take they delay their project. The
flight of birds is watched as an important augury, and the appearance
of a snake as a warning against some approaching calamity.</p>
<p>The mountain tribes are subject to no common ruler, but have their
separate chieftains, called <i>barnaas</i>, to whom a certain number of
dependants is assigned. On the death of a barnaas, the intestines are
extracted, examined and burnt, for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>purpose of
ascertaining by the arts of divination the future destiny of the tribe.
The body is placed in a chair, relations and friends are invited, and a
great festivity of eating and drinking provided from the flocks and
rice-fields of the deceased, with shouts and songs celebrating the
virtues of departed barnaas. The banquet closes with all species of
excesses, and both sexes remain drunk, exhausted or asleep on the
ground about the corpse. It is said that the flesh of the departed is
distributed among the guests, and Buzeta avers that such a case lately
occurred at Tagudin (Ilocos South); but as he attributes it to the
poverty of the deceased who had not left behind wherewithal to provide
for the festival, the carnal distribution could hardly have been deemed
an honour. The stories of the cannibalism of the natives must be
received with distrust, there being a great disposition to represent
them as worse savages than they really are. The arms of a warrior are
gathered together after his death, and his family will not part with
them. A vessel into which wine has been poured is placed at the foot of
the trophies, in order that it may imbibe the virtue and valour of the
departed, and obtain his auspices.</p>
<p>In case of the murder of an individual, the whole of the tribe unite
to revenge his death. Prisoners taken in war are made slaves, and sell
for from ten to twenty-five dollars each. Old men are bought, upon whom
to try the poisonous powers or sharpness of their weapons. Adultery and
the third offence of robbery are punished with death. Polygamy is not
allowed, but there is no difficulty about divorce. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>A great variety of languages is to be found among the wild people of
the interior; not only are dialects of the various tribes
unintelligible to each other, but sometimes a language is confined to a
single family group. Where there has been no intercourse there is no
similitude. Words are necessary to man, and language is created by that
necessity. Hence the farther the study of idioms is pursued back into
antiquity, the greater will their number be found. Civilization has
destroyed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of idioms, and is still carrying
on the work by diminishing the number of languages in which man holds
intercourse with man. It is no bold prophecy to aver that in the course
of centuries the number of separate tongues will be reduced to a small
amount. In France, the French; in Italy, the Tuscan; in Spain, the
Castilian; in Germany, the Saxon; in Great Britain, the
English;&mdash;are becoming the predominant languages of the people,
and have been gradually superseding the multitude of idioms which were
used only a few generations ago. Adelung recorded the names of nearly
4,000 spoken and existing languages, but a list of those which time has
extinguished would be far more extensive.</p>
<p>That such large portions of the islands should be held by
independent tribes, whether heathen or Mahomedan, is not to be wondered
at when the geographical character of the country is considered. Many
of their retreats are inaccessible to beasts of burden; the valleys are
intolerably hot; the mountains unsheltered and cold. There is also much
ignorance as to the localities, and the Spaniards are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>subject to be surprised from unknown ambushes in
passes and ravines. The forests, through which the natives glide like
rabbits, are often impenetrable to Europeans. No attempts have
succeeded in enticing the &ldquo;idolaters&rdquo; down to the plains
from these woods and mountains, to be tutored, taxed and tormented. Yet
it is a subject of complaint that these barbarians interfere, as no
doubt they do, with the royal monopoly of tobacco, which they manage to
smuggle into the provinces. &ldquo;Fiscal officers and troops,&rdquo;
says De Mas, &ldquo;are stationed to prevent these abuses, but these
protectors practise so many extortions on the Indians, and cause so
much of discontent, that commissions of inquiry become needful, and the
difficulties remain unsolved.&rdquo; In some places the idolaters
molest &ldquo;the peaceful Christian population,&rdquo; and make the
roads dangerous to travellers. De Mas has gathered information from
various sources, and from him I shall select a few particulars; but it
appears to me there is too much generalization as to the unsubjugated
tribes, who are to be found in various stages of civilization and
barbarism. The <i>Tinguianes</i> of Ilocos cultivate extensive
rice-fields, have large herds of cattle and horses, and carry on a
considerable trade with the adjacent Christian population. The Chinese
type is said to be traceable in this race. The women wear a number of
bracelets, covering the arm from the wrist to the elbow. The heaviest
Tinguian curse is, &ldquo;May you die while asleep,&rdquo; which is
equivalent to saying, &ldquo;May your death-bed be uncelebrated.&rdquo;
It is a term of contempt for an Indian to say to another,
&ldquo;Malubha ang Caitiman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href=
"#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>mo&rdquo;&mdash;Great is thy
blackness (<i>negregura</i>, Sp.). The Indians call Africans
<i>Pogot</i>.</p>
<p>There are many Albinos in the Philippines. They are called by the
natives Sons of the Sun; some are white, some are spotted, and others
have stripes on their skins. They are generally of small intellectual
capacity.</p>

<p>The Altaban Indians have an idol whom they call <i>Cubiga</i>, whose

is <i>Dalingay</i>. There are no temples nor public rites, but appeals
to the superior spirits in cases of urgency are generally directed by
the female priest or sorceress, who sprinkles the idol with the blood
of a buffalo, fowl or guinea-pig, offers libations, while the Indians
lift up their hands exclaiming, &ldquo;Siggam Cabunian! Siggam
Bulamaiag! Siggam aggen!&rdquo; (O thou God! O thou beautiful moon! O
thou star!) A brush is then dipped in palm wine, which is sprinkled
over the attendants. (This is surely an imitation of Catholic
aspersions.) A general carousing follows.</p>
<p>The priests give many examples of what they call Indian ignorance
and stupidity, but these examples generally amount only to a disclaimer
of all knowledge respecting the mysteries of creation, the origin and
future destiny of man, the nature of religious obligations, and the
dogmas of the Catholic faith. It may be doubted whether the mere
habitual repetition of certain formulas affords more satisfactory
evidence of Christian advancement than the openly avowed ignorance of
these heathen races.</p>
<p>If an Indian is murdered by one of a neighbouring tribe, and the
offence not condoned by some arranged payment, it is deemed an
obligation on the part of the injured to retaliate by killing one of
the offending tribe.</p>
<p>The popular amusement is dancing; they form <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>themselves into a circle, stretching out their
hands, using their feet alternately, leaping on one and lifting the
other behind; so they move round and round with loud cries to the
sounds of cylindrical drums struck by both hands.</p>
<p>The skulls of animals are frequently used for the decoration of the
houses of the Indians. Galvey says he counted in one dwelling, in
Capangar, 405 heads of buffaloes and bullocks, and more than a thousand
of pigs, causing an intolerable stench.</p>
<p>They use the bark of the Uplay in cases of intermittent fever, and
have much knowledge of the curative qualities of certain herbs; they
apply hot iron to counteract severe local pain, so that the flesh
becomes cauterized; but they almost invariably have recourse to amulets
or charms, and sacrifice fowls and animals, which are distributed among
the attendants on the sick persons.</p>
<p>Padre Mozo says of the Italons (Luzon) that he has seen them, after
murdering an enemy, drink his blood, cut up the lungs, the back of the
head, the entrails, and other parts of the body, which they eat raw,
avowing that it gave them courage and spirit in war. The skulls are
kept in their houses to be exhibited on great occasions. This custom is
probably of Bornean origin, for Father Quarteron, the vicar apostolic
of that island, told me that he once fell in with a large number of
savages who were carrying in procession the human skulls with which
their houses were generally adorned, and which they called
&ldquo;giving an airing to their enemies.&rdquo; The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>teeth are inserted in the handles of their
hangers. After enumerating many more of the barbarous customs of the
islands, the good friar Mozo exclaims:&mdash;&ldquo;Fancy our troubles
and labours in rescuing such barbarians from the power of the
devil!&rdquo; They sacrifice as many victims as they find fingers
opened after death. If the hand be closed, none. They suffer much from
cutaneous diseases. The Busaos paint their arms with flowers, and to
carry ornaments bore their ears, which are sometimes stretched down to
their shoulders. The Ifugaos wear on a necklace pieces of cane denoting
the number of enemies they have killed. Galvey says he counted
twenty-three worn by one man who fell in an affray with Spanish troops.
This tribe frequently attacks travellers in the mountains for the sake
of their skulls. The missionaries represent them as the fiercest
enemies of Christians. Some of the monks speak of horrible confessions
made by Igorrote women after their conversion to Christianity, of their
intercourse with monkeys in the woods, and the Padre Lorenzo indulges
in long details on the subject, declaring, moreover, that a creature
was once brought to him for baptism which &ldquo;filled him with
suspicion.&rdquo; De Mas reports that a child with long arms, covered
with soft hair, and much resembling a monkey, was exhibited by his
mother in Viyan, and taught to ask for alms.</p>
<p>De Mas recommends that the Spanish Government should buy the
saleable portion of the Mahomedan and pagan tribes, convert them, and
employ them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>in the cultivation of land; and he gives
statistics to show that there would be an accumulation of 120 per
cent., while their removal would set the Indians together by the ears,
who would destroy one another, and relieve the islands from the plague
of their presence. This would seem a new chapter in the history of
slave-trade experiments. He calculates that there are more than a
million pagans and Mahomedans in the islands. Galvey&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Diary of an Expedition to Benguet in January, 1829,&rdquo; and
another to Bacun in December, 1831, are histories of personal
adventures, many of a perilous character, in which many lives were
lost, and many habitations destroyed. They are interesting as
exhibiting the difficulties of subjugating these mountain races. Galvey
conducted several other expeditions, and died in 1839.</p>
<p>There are few facts of more interest, in connection with the changes
that are going on in the Oriental world, than the outpouring of the
surplus Chinese population into almost every region eastwards of
Bengal; and in Calcutta itself there is now a considerable body of
Chinese, mostly shoemakers, many of whom have acquired considerable
wealth, and they are banded together in that strong gregarious bond of
nationality which accompanies them wherever they go, and which is not
broken, scarcely even influenced, by the circumstances that surround
them. In the islands of the Philippines they have obtained almost a
monopoly of the retail trade, and the indolent habits of the natives
cannot at all compete with these industrious, frugal, and persevering
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>intruders. Hence they are objects of great
dislike to the natives; but, as their generally peaceful demeanour and
obedience to the laws give no hold to their enemies, their numbers,
their wealth, their importance increase from year to year. Yet they are
but birds of passage, who return home to be succeeded by others of
their race. They never bring their wives, but take to themselves wives
or hand-maidens from the native tribes. Legitimate marriage, however,
necessitates the profession of Christianity, and many of them care
little for the public avowal of subjection to the Church of Rome. They
are allowed no temple to celebrate Buddhist rites, but have cemeteries
specially appropriated to them. They pay a fixed contribution, which is
regulated by the rank they hold as merchants, traders, shopkeepers,
artisans, servants, &amp;c. Whole streets in Manila are occupied by
them, and wherever we went we found them the most laborious, the most
prosperous of the working classes. Thousands upon thousands of Chinamen
arrive, and are scattered over the islands, but not a single Chinese
woman accompanies them from their native country.</p>
<p>In the year 1857, 4,232 Chinamen landed in the port of Manila alone,
and 2,592 left for China.</p>
<p>Of the extraordinary unwillingness of the women of China to
emigrate, no more remarkable evidence can be found than in the
statistics of the capital of the Philippines. In 1855, there were in
the fortress of Manila 525 Chinamen, but of females only two women and
five children. In Binondo, 5,055 Chinamen, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>but
of females only eight, all of whom were children. Now, when it is
remembered that the Philippines are, with a favourable monsoon, not
more than three or four days&rsquo; sail from China, that there are
abundance of opulent Chinese settled in the island, that the desire of
having children and perpetuating a race is universal among the Chinese
people, it may be easily conceived that there must be an intensely
popular feeling opposed to the emigration of women.</p>
<p>And such is undoubtedly the fact, and it is a fact which must prove
a great barrier to successful coolie emigration. No women have been
obtainable either for the British or Spanish colonies, though the
exportation of coolies had exceeded 60,000, and except by kidnapping
and direct purchase from the procuresses or the brothels, it is certain
no woman can be induced to emigrate. This certainty ought to be
seriously weighed by the advocates of the importation of Chinese
labourers into the colonies of Great Britain. In process of time, Hong
Kong will probably furnish some voluntary female emigrants, and the
late legalization of emigration by the Canton authorities will
accelerate the advent of a result so desirable.</p>
<p>During five years, ending in 1855, there were for grave crimes only
fourteen committals of Chinamen in the whole of the provinces, being an
average of less than three per annum; no case of murder, none of
robbery with violence, none for rape. There were nine cases of larceny,
two of cattle-stealing, one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>forgery, one coining, one
incendiarism. These facts are greatly creditable to the morality of the
Chinese settlers. Petty offences are punished, as in the case of the
Indians, by their own local principalia.</p>
<p>A great majority of the shoemakers in the Philippines are Chinese.
Of 784 in the capital, 633 are Chinamen, and 151 natives. Great numbers
are carpenters, blacksmiths, water-carriers, cooks, and daily
labourers, but a retail shopkeeping trade is the favourite pursuit. Of
late, however, many are merging into the rank of wholesale dealers and
merchants, exporting and importing large quantities of goods on their
own account, and having their subordinate agents scattered over most of
the islands. Where will not a Chinaman penetrate&mdash;what risks will
he not run&mdash;to what suffering will he not submit&mdash;what
enterprises will he not engage in&mdash;what perseverance will he not
display&mdash;if money is to be made? And, in truth, this constitutes
his value as a settler: he is economical, patient, persistent, cunning;
submissive to the laws, respectful to authority, and seeking only
freedom from molestation while he adds dollar to dollar, and when the
pile is sufficient for his wants or his ambition, he returns home, to
be succeeded by others, exhibiting the same qualities, and in their
turn to be rewarded by the same success.</p>
<p>When encouragement was first given to the Chinese to settle in the
Philippines, it was as agricultural labourers, and they were not
allowed to exercise any other calling. The Japanese were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>also
invited, of whom scarcely any are now to be found in the islands. The
reputation of the Chinese as cultivators of the land no doubt directed
the attention of the Manila authorities towards them; but no Chinaman
continues in any career if he can discover another more profitable.
Besides this, they were no favourites among the rural population, and
in their gregarious nature were far more willing to band themselves
together in groups and <i>hwey</i> (associations) than to disperse
themselves among the pastoral and agricultural races, who were jealous
of them as rivals and hated them as heathens. They have created for
themselves a position in the towns, and are now too numerous and too
wealthy to be disregarded or seriously oppressed. They are mostly from
the province of Fokien, and Amoy is the principal port of their
embarkation. I did not find among them a single individual who spoke
the classical language of China, though a large proportion read the
Chinese character.</p>
<p>When a Chinese is examined on oath, the formula of cutting off the
head of a white cock is performed by the witness, who is told that, if
he do not utter the truth, the blood of his family will, like that of
the cock, be spilt and perdition overtake them. My long experience of
the Chinese compels me to say that I believe no oath
whatever&mdash;nothing but the apprehension of punishment&mdash;affords
any, the least security against perjury. In our courts in China various
forms have at different times been used&mdash;cock beheading; the
breaking of a piece of pottery; the witness repeating <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>imprecations on himself, and inviting the
breaking up of all his felicities if he lied; the burning of a piece of
paper inscribed with a form of oath, and an engagement to be consumed
in hell, as that paper on earth, if he spoke not the truth;&mdash;these
and other ceremonies have utterly failed in obtaining any security for
veracity. While I was governor of Hong Kong an ordinance was passed
abolishing the oath-taking, as regards the Chinese, and punishing them
severely as perjurers when they gave false testimony. The experiment
has succeeded in greatly fortifying and encouraging the utterance of
truth and in checking obscurity and mendacity. I inquired once of an
influential person in Canton what were the ceremonies employed among
themselves where they sought security for truthful evidence. He said
there was one temple in which a promise made would be held more binding
than if made in any other locality; but he <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3974" title="Source: acknowleged">acknowledged</span> their
tribunals had no real security for veracity. There is a Chinese proverb
which says, &ldquo;Puh tah, puh chaou,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;Without
blows, no truth;&rdquo; and the torture is constantly applied to
witnesses in judicial cases. The Chinese religiously respect their
written, and generally their ceremonial, engagements&mdash;they
&ldquo;lose face&rdquo; if these are dishonoured. But little disgrace
attends lying, especially when undetected and unpunished, and the art
of lying is one of the best understood arts of government. Lies to
deceive barbarians are even recommended and encouraged in some of their
classical books. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The supreme court of justice in the Philippines is the
<i lang="es">Audiencia</i> established in Manila, which is the tribunal
of appeal from the subordinate jurisdiction, and the consultative
council of the Governor-General in cases of gravity.</p>
<p>The court is composed of seven <i lang="es">oidores</i>, or judges.
The president takes the title of Regent. There are two government
advocates, one for criminal, the other for civil causes, and a variety
of subordinate officers. There are no less than eighty barristers,
matriculated to practise in the Audiencia.</p>
<p>A <i lang="es">Tribunal de Comercio</i>, presided over by a judge
nominated by the authorities, and assisted, under the title of <i lang=
"es">Consules</i>, by gentlemen selected from the principal mercantile
establishments of the capital, is charged with the settlement of
commercial disputes. There is a right of appeal to the Audiencia, but
scarcely any instance of its being exercised. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is a censorship called the <i lang="es">Comercia permanente de
censura</i>. It consists of four ecclesiastics and four civilians,
presided over by the civil fiscal, and its authority extends to all
books imported into or printed in the islands.</p>
<p>There are fourscore lawyers (<i lang="es">abogados</i>) in Manila.
As far as my experience goes, lawyers are the curse of colonies. I
remember one of the most intelligent of the Chinese merchants who had
settled at Singapore, after having been long established at Hong Kong,
telling me that all the disadvantages of Singapore were more than
compensated by the absence of &ldquo;the profession,&rdquo; and all the
recommendations of Hong Kong more than counterbalanced by the presence
of gentlemen occupied in fomenting, and recompensed for fomenting,
litigations and quarrels. Many of them make large fortunes, not
unfrequently at the expense of substantial justice. A sound observer
says, that in the Philippines truth is swamped by the superfluity of
law documents. The doors opened for the protection of innocence are
made entrances for chicanery, and discussions are carried on without
any regard to the decorum which prevails in European courts. Violent
invectives, recriminations, personalities, and calumnies, are ventured
upon under the protection of professional privilege. When I compare the
equitable, prompt, sensible and inexpensive judgments of the consular
courts in China with the results of the costly, tardy, unsatisfactory
technicalities of judicial proceedings in many colonies, I would desire
a general proviso that no tribunal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188"
href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>should be accessible in civil
cases until after an examination by a court of conciliation. The
extortions to which the Chinese are subjected, in Hong Kong, for
example&mdash;and I speak from personal knowledge&mdash;make one blush
for &ldquo;the squeezing&rdquo; to which, indeed, the corruption of
their own mandarins have but too much accustomed them. In the
Philippines there is a great mass of unwritten, or at least unprinted,
law, emanating from different and independent sources, often
contradictory, introduced traditionally, quoted erroneously; a farrago,
in which the &ldquo;<span lang="es">Leyes de Indias</span>,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;<span lang="es">Siete partidas</span>,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;<span lang="es">Novisima recompilacion</span>,&rdquo; the Roman
code, the ancient and the royal fueros&mdash;to say nothing of
proclamations, decrees, notifications, orders, bandos&mdash;produce all
the &ldquo;toil and trouble&rdquo; of the witches&rsquo; cauldron,
stirred by the evil genii of discord and disputation.</p>
<p>Games of chance (<i lang="es">juegos de azar</i>) are strictly
prohibited in the Philippines, but the prohibition is utterly
inefficient; and, as I have mentioned before, the Manila papers are
crowded with lists of persons fined or imprisoned for violation of the
law; sometimes forty or fifty are cited in a single newspaper. More
than one captain-general has informed me that the severity of the
penalty has not checked the universality of the offence, connived at
and participated in by both ecclesiastics and civilians.</p>
<p>The fines are fifty dollars for the first, and one hundred dollars
for the second, offence, and for the third, the punishment which
attaches to vagabondage&mdash;imprisonment and the chain-gang.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>Billiard-tables pay a tax of six dollars per month. There is an
inferior wooden table which pays half that sum.</p>
<p>The criminal statistics of five years, from 1851 to 1855 present the
following total number of convictions for the graver offences. They
comprise the returns from all the provinces. Of the whole number of
criminals, more than one-half are from 20 to 29 years old; one-third
from 30 to 39; one-ninth from 40 to 49; one-twentieth from 15 to 19;
and one-forty-fifth above 50.</p>
<p>They consist of 467 married, 81 widowers, and 690 unmarried men.</p>
<p>During the said period 236 had completed the terms of their
sentences, 217 had died, and 785 remained at the date of the
returns.</p>

<p>In the city of Manila there was only one conviction <span class=

murder in five years. The proportion of the graver offences in the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The army of the Philippines, with the exception of two
brigades of artillery and a corps of engineers which are furnished by
Spain, is recruited from the Indians, and presents an appearance
generally satisfactory. They are wholly officered by Europeans.</p>
<p>There are nine regiments of native infantry, one of cavalry, called
the Luzon Lancers, and there is a reserve corps of officers called
<i lang="es">Cuadro de Remplazos</i>, from whom individuals are
selected to fill up vacancies.</p>
<p>There is a small body of <i lang="es">Alabarderos de servicio</i> at
the palace in the special service of the captain-general. Their origin
dates from <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1590, and their halberds and
costume add to the picturesque character of the palace and the
receptions there.</p>
<p>There are also four companies called the Urban Militia of Manila,
composed of Spaniards, who may be called upon by the governor for
special services or in cases of emergency.</p>
<p>A medical board exercises a general inspection over the troops. Its
superior functionaries are European <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>Spaniards. Hospitals
in which the military invalids are received are subject to the
authority of the medical board as far as the treatment of such invalids
is concerned. The medical board nominates an officer to each of the
regiments, who is called an <i lang="es">Ayudante</i>.</p>
<p>Of late a considerable body of native troops has been sent from
Manila to Cochin China, in order to co-operate with the French military
and marine forces in that country. They are reported to have behaved
well in a service which can have had few attractions, and in which they
have been exposed to many sufferings, in consequence of the climate and
the hostile attitude of the native inhabitants. What object the
Spaniards had in taking so important a part in this expedition to
Touron remains hitherto unexplained. Territory and harbours in Oriental
regions, rich and abundant, they hold in superfluity; and assuredly
Cochin China affords nothing very inviting to well-informed ambition;
nor are the Philippines in a condition to sacrifice their population to
distant, uncertain, perilous, and costly adventures. There is no
national pride to be flattered by Annamite conquests, and the murder of
a Spanish bishop may be considered as atoned for by the destruction of
the forts and scattering of the people, at the price, however, of the
lives of hundreds of Christians and of a heavy pecuniary outlay. France
has its purposes&mdash;frankly enough disclosed&mdash;to obtain some
port, some possession of her own, in or near the China seas. I do not
think such a step warrants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=
"#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>distrust or jealousy on our part.
The question may be asked, whether the experiment is worth the cost?
Probably not, for France has scarcely any commercial interest in China
or the neighbouring countries; nor is her colonial system, fettered as
it always has been by protections and prohibitions, likely to create
such interest. In the remote East, France can carry on no successful
rivalry with Great Britain, the United States, Holland, or Spain, each
of which has points of geographical superiority and influence which to
France are not accessible. One condition is a <i lang="la">sine
qu&acirc; non</i> in these days of trading rivalry&mdash;lowness of
price, associated with cheapness of transport. France offers neither to
the foreign consumer in any of the great articles of supply: she
<i>will</i> have high prices for <i>her</i> producers.</p>
<p>The maritime forces are under the orders of the commandant of the
station. They consist of four steamers and one brig-of-war, six
gunboats, and a considerable number of <i lang="es">faluas</i>
(feluccas), which are employed in the coasting service and for the
suppression of piracy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=

<p class="first">Public instruction is in an unsatisfactory state in
the Philippines&mdash;the provisions are little changed from those of
the monkish ages.</p>
<p>In the University of St. Thomas there are about a thousand students.
The professorships are of theology, the canon and civil law,
metaphysics and grammar; but no attention is given to the natural
sciences, to the modern languages, nor have any of the educational
reforms which have penetrated most of the colleges of Europe and
America found their way to the Philippines. In the <i lang=
"es">colegios</i> and schools what is called philosophy, rhetoric and
Latin are the principal objects of attention. The most numerously
attended of these establishments were founded two or three centuries
ago, and pursue the same course of instruction which was adopted at
their first establishment. There are several colleges and convents for
women. That of Santa Potenciana was established under a royal decree,
dated <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1589, which requires that girls
(<i lang="es">doncellas</i>) be received and taught to &ldquo;live
modestly&rdquo; (<i lang="es">honestamente</i>), and, under sound
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>doctrine, to &ldquo;come out&rdquo; for
&ldquo;marriage and propagation of the race&rdquo; (<i lang="es">hagan
propagacion</i>). There is a nautical school, of which I heard a
favourable report, and an academy of painting, which has hitherto
produced no Murillo or Velasquez. The best native works of art which I
saw were two heads of the Virgin and St. Francisco, carved by an Indian
in ivory, and which adorn the convent of Lucban, in the province of
Tayabas. The good friars attributed to them almost miraculous virtues,
and assured me that, though heavy rains preceded and followed the
processions in which the images were introduced, a bright and beautiful
sunshine accompanied them in their progress.</p>
<p>Among the novel objects that meet the eye in Manila, especially on
the morning of religious <i lang="es">fiestas</i>, are groups of veiled
women, wearing a dark mysterious costume, who visit the different
churches. Their dress is a black woollen or silken petticoat, over
which is a large shining mantilla, or veil, of a deep mulberry colour;
others wear the ancient hooded Andalusian black cloak. There are the
sisterhoods called the <i lang="es">Colegialas de los
Beaterios</i>&mdash;religious establishments in which young women
receive their education; some supported by &ldquo;pious
foundations,&rdquo; others by voluntary contributions. The rules of
these convents vary, as some of the nuns never quit the buildings,
others visit the churches under the guardianship of a
&ldquo;mother;&rdquo; in some it is permitted to the colegiala to join
her family at certain seasons, and to participate in social enjoyments
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>at home or abroad. These pay for their education
sums varying from two to eight dollars a month, according to the
regulations of the different beaterios, which have also their
distinguishing costumes in some of the details, such as the colour of
the lining of their dress. It is said there is scarcely a family of
respectability in Manila that has not one daughter at least in a
beaterio. In that of Santa Rosa the monthly pay is five dollars. Its
inmates rise at five <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, to chant the
<i lang="es">trisagio</i> (holy, holy, holy), to hear mass and engage
in devotion for the first part of the rosary till six; then to wash and
dress; breakfast at half-past six; instruction from seven to ten;
dinner at half-past eleven in the refectory; siesta and rest till
half-past two <span class="sc">P.M.</span>; devotion in the chapel,
going through the second part of the rosary; instruction from half-past
three till half-past five; at the &ldquo;oration,&rdquo; they return to
the chapel, recite the third part of the rosary, and engage in reading
or meditation for half an hour; sup at eight <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span>; enjoy themselves in the cloister or garden till nine;
another prayer, and they retire to their cells. In the beaterio of St.
Sebastian of Calumpang the inmates rise at four <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span>: the pay is five dollars; but the general arrangements
are the same as those described. In the beaterio of Santa Catalina de
Sena they are not allowed to leave the convent. The pay is eight
dollars: it has the reputation of superior accommodation, and less
economical food. The beaterio of the Jesuits has about 900 inmates; but
this number is much exceeded in Lent, when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>great numbers enter to perform their spiritual
exercises. The pay is only two dollars per month; but much sewing and
washing is done within the convent for its support. When the Jesuits
were expelled, the direction of this beaterio passed to the
vicar-general of the archbishopric.</p>
<p>The beaterio of Pasig is solely devoted to the reception of Indian
orphans, and its founder required that they should be taught
&ldquo;Christian doctrine, sewing, reading, writing, embroidery, and
other instruction becoming the sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many charitable institutions in Manila. The Jesuits,
afterwards expelled from the Philippines by Carlos II., founded several
of the most important. The Hospital of San Juan de Dios has 112 beds;
that of San Jos&eacute; de Cavite 250, of which 104 are for soldiers,
and the rest for paupers and criminals. There is an <i lang=
"es">Administracion de Obras Pias</i>, under the direction of the
archbishop, the regent, and some of the superior civil authorities,
which lends money to the Indians to the value of two-thirds of their
landed property, one-half of their value on plate and jewellery, and
insures vessels employed in the coasting trade. A <i lang="es">caja de
comunidad</i> exacts half a rial (3&frac14;<i>d.</i>) annually from the
Chinese and Indians for the payment of &ldquo;schoolmasters,
vaccinators, defence of criminals, chanters, and sacristans of
churches.&rdquo; The fund is administered by the directing board of
finance.</p>
<p>The history of the Hospital of St. Lazarus, under charge of the
Franciscan friars, is not without interest. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>It
was constructed for the use of the natives in 1578, was enlarged, and
twice consumed by fire. In the year 1632, it received 150 Christian
lepers exiled from Japan, and thence took its present name. It was
demolished by the captain-general in 1662, when the Chinese pirates
menaced the capital, as it was deemed an impediment to the defence of
the place. The inmates were removed; and another hospital was built,
which was again destroyed in 1783, in consequence of its having been
useful to the English in their invasion in 1762; but a few years
afterwards the present edifice was built on lands which belonged to the
Jesuits before the extinction of their society in the Philippines.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are in the Philippines one archiepiscopal and
three episcopal sees. The metropolitan archbishopric of Manila was
founded by Clement VII. in 1595, and endowed by Philip II. with a
revenue of 500,000 maravedis (= 200<i>l.</i> sterling). The bishopric
of New Segovia was created at the same time with a similar endowment.
The see is now (1859) vacant. The bishopric of Cebu was established in
1567, soon after the conquest of the island by the Spaniards. Nueva
Caceres has also a bishop. The selection of candidates for these
ecclesiastical honours has been generally left to the religious
brotherhood who are most numerous in the district where<a id=
"xd21e4350" name="xd21e4350"></a> there is a vacancy, and the
candidate, being approved by the sovereign of Spain, is submitted to
the Pope for confirmation. Some nominations have taken place where the
bishop elect has not been willing to quit the mother-country for the
colonies, which I was informed had caused the adoption of a resolution
not to <span class="corr" id="xd21e4352" title=
"Source: instal">install</span> a bishop until <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>he
has taken possession of his see. Most of the ecclesiastical authority
is in the hands of the friars or regular clergy. There are
proportionally few secular priests in the islands. The Dominicans and
Augustine monks have large possessions, especially in the central and
southern provinces; the Franciscans are most numerous in the northern.
To the hospitality and kindness of the friars during the whole of my
journey I bear a willing and grateful testimony. Everywhere the
convents were opened to us with cordial welcome, and I attribute much
of the display of attention on the part of the Indians to the reception
we everywhere experienced from the Spanish padres. The Dominican monks
have charge of the mission to Fokien, in China, and Tonquin.</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical records of the Philippines overflow with
evidences of the bitter, and sometimes bloody, controversies of the
Church with the civil authority, and with quarrels of the religious
bodies among themselves. In the year 1710 the Dominicans declared
themselves not subject to the jurisdiction of diocesan visits. One of
their resolutions says:&mdash;&ldquo;The provinces hold it for evident
and certain that such visits would lead to the perdition of religious
ministers, which is the opinion that has been for many years held by
grave and zealous ecclesiastics and superior prelates who have dwelt in
the province.&rdquo; In 1757 the Augustine friars (<i lang=
"es">calzados</i>) were menaced with the confiscation of their property
if they denied the supreme authority and the admission <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>of
parochial curates regularly appointed; and they resolved that such
submission &ldquo;would be the ruin of their institution and to the
notable detriment of souls.&rdquo; In 1767 Benedict XIV. published a
bull insisting on the recognition of the metropolitan authority, which
was still resisted by the Augustines. In 1775 a royal mandate was
issued at Madrid insisting that all regular curates be submitted to
their provincial in questions <i lang="la">de vit&acirc; et
moribus</i>, to the bishop, in all matters of spiritual administration,
and to the captain-general as vice-regal patron. Whether the
ecclesiastical police is better kept by the interference of the higher
authorities, or by the independent action among themselves of the
different religious orders, is a question much debated, but the
substantive fact remains that the friar has an enormous and
little-controlled influence in the locality of his <i>cure</i>, and
that where abuses exist it is very difficult to collect evidence, and
still more so to inflict punishment in case of his misdoings.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that, in the language of Tomas de Comyn,
&ldquo;the missionaries were the real conquerors of the Philippines;
their arms were not, indeed, those of the warrior, but they gave laws
to millions, and, scattered though they were, they established by unity
of purpose and of action a permanent empire over immense multitudes of
men.&rdquo; Up to the present hour there are probably few parishes in
which the gobernadorcillo, having received a mandate from the civil
authority, fails to consult the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202"
href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>friar, and the efficiency and
activity of the Indian functionary in giving effect to the mandate will
much depend on the views the padre may take of the orders issued.</p>
<p>Religious processions are the pride and the passion of the
Filipinos, and on great festivals they bring together prodigious crowds
both as actors and spectators. The most brilliant are those which take
place after sunset, when some thousands of persons carry lighted wax
candles, and the procession is sometimes a mile long, composed of all
the military and civil authorities and of the ecclesiastical
functionaries, vying with each other in the display of their zeal and
devotion. On these occasions splendidly dressed images of the various
objects of veneration form an important part of the ceremonial. I was
assured that the jewels worn by the image of <i lang="es">Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora de la Imaculada Concepcion</i> on the day of her festival
exceeded 25,000 dollars in value. Numerous bands of music accompany the
show. One of the most interesting parts of the exhibition is the number
of little girls prettily and fancifully dressed in white, who follow
some of the images of the saints or the <i lang="es">palio</i> of the
archbishop. One of the processions witnessed was forty minutes in
passing, and of immense length, the whole way being lined with bearers
of wax lights on both sides. There seems a rivalry among the religious
orders as to whose displays shall be the most effective and imposing.
The images are of the size of life, and clad in gorgeous garments
encumbered with ornaments<span class="corr" id="xd21e4382" title=
"Not in source">.</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>They are borne on the shoulders of
their votaries, occupying a platform, whence they are visible to the
crowd.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4387src" href="#xd21e4387" name=
"xd21e4387src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204"
name="pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>These religious ceremonials, so dear to, and so characteristic of,
the Filipinos, are called <i lang="es">Pentacasi</i>. Everybody seems
to take a part, whether within or without doors. All invite or are
invited, and busy hands are engaged in making sweetmeats, preparing
meats, or adorning apartments (with furniture borrowed from all sides,
a favour to be reciprocated in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205"
href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>turn), musicians are
collected, strangers are sought for, and universal bustle pervades the
locality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the eve preceding the festival,&rdquo; says a native
author, describing what takes place in the neighbourhood of Manila,
&ldquo;the pueblo exhibits all the activity of preparation. In the
streets, handsome arches are constructed of bamboo, covered with
painted linen, and representing various orders of architecture;
graceful drapery is suspended over the arch, which has sundry openings
or windows, in which variegated lanterns are placed (an art taught, no
doubt, by the Chinese, who possess it in perfection). Within the
lanterns ornamented figures are kept in perpetual movement by the
heated atmosphere. Nosegays of artificial flowers, groups of fruits,
and various devices decorate the houses, and the local musicians
serenade the priests and the authorities; while the whole population
crowd the church for the vesper service. The <i lang="tl">dalagas</i>
(girls) prepare their gayest attire to take part in the procession, in
which queens and saints and various scriptural personages are
represented by the Zagalas or females of the leading families, in
garments of velvet and gold, with all the jewels that can be
collected&mdash;not that always the costume testifies to much classical
or historical knowledge; it is, however, very gay and gorgeous,
satisfactory to the wearers, admired and applauded by the spectators.
Popular songs are sung to the music of the guitar, and the gaieties are
carried on to the midnight hour. At eight o&rsquo;clock on the
following morning mass is attended, a sermon preached, a procession
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>follows, and all retire to their dwellings to
escape the heat of the day; but in the principal houses repasts are
ready for any guests who may call, and a considerable variety of Indian
dishes are laid out upon the table. At four <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span>, the military arrive with their music, and generally
the village musicians and the church choir assemble near the church,
and welcome the many visitors who come from the capital. So great is
the crowd of carriages, that they are not allowed to pass through the
streets, but their occupiers quit them at the entrance of the pueblo,
and make their way to the hosts who have invited them. A great number
of Spanish ladies from Manila are generally seated at the windows to
witness the busy scene. Not only are the streets crowded by the gaily
dressed inhabitants, but multitudes of Indians come from the interior
to take part in the festivity. The native authorities, preceded by
music, then visit the various houses to collect the Zagalas, who come
forth in their regal robes and crowns, with a suite of attendants.
There is a great display of fireworks, rockets, and balloons, and the
procession proceeds to the church. It is a grand day for the gallera,
or cockpit, which resembles the bull-fight arena in Spain: it is filled
to suffocation with noisy and excited actors and spectators; immense
bets are laid; booths surround the place, where food and drink are
sold, and among the delicacies roasted sucking-pigs abound. The
procession usually starts at six <span class="sc">P.M.</span> All those
who take part bear a lighted wax-candle: first, the children of the
pueblo; then the soldiers; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>then the image of the Virgin, with
an escort of veiled women; then the image of the saint of the day or of
the place, the car drawn by a number of dalagas in white garments,
bearing garlands and crowns of flowers, followed by the authorities and
by the priest in his golden cope; then a military band and cavalry
soldiers; then the principal Zagala, whose queenly train is borne by
eight or ten Indian girls, in white garments, adorned with flowers.
Other Zagalas, personifying the Christian virtues, follow&mdash;Faith,
Hope, Charity, with their characteristic attributes. Sometimes there
are cars in which scenes of Scripture are exhibited by living actors;
others displaying all the fancies of devotees. The procession parades
the streets till the night is far advanced; the images are then
restored to the church, and other amusements begin. The principal
guests are invited to an open, but temporarily erected building,
handsomely curtained, and brilliantly lighted, in the centre of which
is a large table, covered with delicacies, and ornamented with groups
and pyramids of flowers. The first attentions are shown to the
ecclesiastics, and then to the other visitors, according to their rank
and position. The streets and houses being illuminated as the night
advances, the principal inhabitants gather their guests together, and
at ten <span class="sc">P.M.</span> there are displays of fireworks and
balloons, in which the rivalry of the pyrotechnic artists of the
capital have a fine field for exercise. Most of the pueblos around
Manila have their festival days, and in the competition for giving
glory to their local saints and patrons, they seek to outdo the capital
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>itself. Santa Cruz, which is an opulent and
populous locality, rejoices in the protection of St. Stanislaus, and
outbids most of the rest for ostentatious show, in which the
inhabitants of Manila take an active part. The Chinese have their day
in celebrating St. Nicholas in Guadalupe. Tondo has its distinguished
festivals. Binondo is great and gorgeous on the day of &ldquo;Our Lady
of the Rosary of Saint Dominic.&rdquo; Sampaloc claims &ldquo;Our Lady
of Loreto.&rdquo; Santa Ana worships &ldquo;Our Lady of the abandoned
ones&rdquo; (<i lang="es">de los desamparados</i>). Pandacan has its
gatherings in honour of &ldquo;The sweet name of Jesus,&rdquo; and its
beautiful scenery adds to the attractions of the place. St. Sebastian
processionizes its silver car, in which &ldquo;Our Lady of
Carmel&rdquo; is conveyed in state. The suspensions caused by the rainy
months, Lent, and a few other interruptions, are compensated by the
extra ceremonials and festivities of the holy weeks, and other seasons
of Catholic gratulation. The mere list of all these <i lang=
"es">fiestas</i> would occupy pages, and it was my good fortune to
visit the islands at a time when I had an opportunity of witnessing
many of these characteristic exhibitions.</p>
<p>The opulence of the individual monks, and of some of the monkish
fraternities in the islands, has often and naturally been a subject of
reproach. The revenues received by individuals are in many localities
very large, amounting in remote districts to eight or nine thousand
dollars a year, and much more, it is reported, in such populous pueblos
as Binondo. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>Some of these communities also possess large
tracts of land, whose management is superintended at periodical
meetings held in the capital, when friars from the different provinces,
and of the same brotherhood, are summoned to give an account of their
stewardship, and to discuss the general interests of the fraternity.
The accumulations of the friars pass to the convents at their death,
but they have little difficulty in disposing of them while living.</p>
<p>It has been said that the policy of the friars in the Philippines is
to conduct the Indian to heaven by a pathway of flowers. Little
molestation will he experience from his ghostly father, if he be strict
in his religious observances, pay his regular contributions to Church
and State, and exhibit those outward marks of respect and reverence
which the representatives of the Deity claim as their lawful heritage;
but there are many thorns amidst the flowers, and drawbacks, on the
heavenly road; and the time may come when higher and nobler aspirations
than those which now satisfy the poor untutored, or little tutored,
Indian, will be his rule of conduct.</p>
<p>The personal courtesies, the kind reception and multifarious
attentions which I received from the friars in every part of the
Philippines naturally dispose me to look upon them with a friendly eye.
I found among them men worthy of being loved and honoured, some of
considerable intellectual vigour; but literary cultivation and
scientific acquirements are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>rare. Occupied with their own
concerns, they are little acquainted with mundane affairs. Politics,
geography, history, have no charms for those who, even had they the
disposition for study, would, in their seclusion and remoteness, have
access to few of its appliances. Their convents are almost palatial,
with extensive courts, grounds and gardens; their revenues frequently
enormous. Though their mode of life is generally unostentatious and
simple, many of them keep handsome carriages and have the best horses
in the locality; and they are surrounded generally by a prostrate and
superstitious population, upon whose hopes and fears, thoughts and
feelings, they exercise an influence which would seem magical were it
not by their devotees deemed divine. This influence, no doubt, is
greatly due to the heroism, labours, sufferings and sacrifices of the
early missionaries, and to the admirably organized hierarchy of the
Roman Church, whose ramifications reach to the extremest points in
which any of the forms or semblances of Christianity are to be
discovered. Volumes upon volumes&mdash;the folio records of the
proceedings of the different religious orders, little known to
Protestant readers&mdash;fill the library shelves of these Catholic
establishments, which are the receptacles of their religious
history.</p>
<p>The most extensively influential brotherhood in the Philippines is
that of the Augustines (<i lang="es">Agostinos Calzados</i>), who
administer to the cure of more than a million and a half of souls. The
barefooted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>Augustines (<i lang="es">Agostinos
Descalzos</i>, or <i lang="es">Recoletos</i>) claim authority over
about one-third of this number. The Dominicans occupy the next rank,
and their congregations are scarcely less numerous than those of the
barefooted Augustines. Next come the Franciscans, who are supposed to
rank with the Dominicans in the extent of their authority.
Independently of the monastic orders and the superior ecclesiastic
authorities, there are but a small number of parochial or secular
clergy in the Philippines.</p>
<p>On occasions of installations under the &ldquo;royal seal,&rdquo;
the ceremonies take place in the church of the Augustines, the oldest
in Manila, where also the regimental flags receive their benediction,
and other public civil festivals are celebrated. A convent is attached
to the church. Both the regular Augustines and the Recoletos receive
pecuniary assistance from the State. The Franciscans rank next to the
Augustines in the number of their clergy.</p>
<p>A source of influence possessed by the friars, and from which a
great majority of civil functionaries are excluded, is the mastery of
the native languages. All the introductory studies of ecclesiastical
aspirants are dedicated to this object. No doubt they have great
advantages from living habitually among the Indian people, with whom
they keep up the most uninterrupted intercourse, and of whose concerns
they have an intimate knowledge. One of the most obvious means of
increasing the power of the civil departments would be in encouragement
given to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>their functionaries for the acquirement of the
native idioms. I believe Spanish is not employed in the pulpits
anywhere beyond the capital. In many of the pueblos there is not a
single individual Indian who understands Castilian, so that the priest
is often the only link between the government and the community, and,
as society is now organized, a necessary link. It must be recollected,
too, that the different members of the religious brotherhoods are bound
together by stronger bonds and a more potent and influential
organization than any official hierarchy among civilians; and the
government can expect no co-operation from the priesthood in any
measures which tend to the diminution of ecclesiastical authority or
jurisdiction, and yet the subjection of that authority to the State,
and its limitation wherever it interferes with the public well-being,
is the great necessity and the all-important problem to be solved in
the Philippines. But here, too, the <i>Catholic</i> character of the
government itself presents an enormous and almost invincible
difficulty. Nothing is so dear to a Spaniard in general as his
religion; his orthodoxy is his pride and glory, and upon this
foundation the Romish Church naturally builds up a political power and
is able to intertwine its pervading influence with all the machinery of
the civil government. The Dutch have no such embarrassment in their
archipelago.</p>
<p>The Captain-General has had the kindness to furnish me with the
latest returns of the ecclesiastical <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>corporations in the
Philippines (dated 1859). They are these:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The Tag&aacute;l and Bisayan are the most widely
spread of the languages of the Philippines, but each has such a variety
of idioms that the inhabitants of different islands and districts
frequently are not intelligible to one another, still less the
indigenous races who occupy the mountainous districts. The more
remarkable divisions are the dialects of Pampangas, Zambal, Pangasinan,
Ilocos, Cagayan, Camarines, Batanes, and Chamorro, each derived from
one of the two principal branches. But the languages of the unconverted
Indians are very various, and have little affinity. Of these I
understand above thirty distinct vocabularies exist. The <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4946" title="Source: connexion">connection</span>
between and the construction of the Tag&aacute;l and Bisayan will be
best seen by a comparison of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in each, with a
verbal rendering of the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>A vocabulary of the Tagal was printed in 1613 by Padre San
Buenaventura; and a folio <i lang="es">Vocabulario</i> by Fr. Domingo
de los Santos, in Sampaloc (Manila), 1794. This vocabulary consists of
nearly 11,000 terms, the same word conveying so many meanings that the
actual number of Tagal words can scarcely exceed 3,500. The examples of
distinct interpretations of each are innumerable.</p>
<p>Another <i lang="es">Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala</i>, by
&ldquo;various grave and learned persons,&rdquo; corrected and arranged
by the Jesuit Fathers Juan de Noceda and Pedro de San Lucar, was
published in Valladolid in 1832. The editor says he would fain have got
rid of the task, but the &ldquo;blind obedience&rdquo; he owed to his
superior compelled him to persevere. Rules for the accurate grammatical
construction of the language cannot, he says, be given, on account of
the exceptions and counter-exceptions. The confusion between active and
passive participles is a labyrinth he cannot explore. There are more
books on the language (<i lang="es">artes</i>), he avers, than on any
dead or living language! He has consulted no less than thirty-seven,
among which the first place is due to the Tag&aacute;l Demosthenes
(Father Francis de San Jos&eacute;), to whose researches none have the
knowledge of adding anything valuable. He professes to have given all
the roots, but not their ramifications, which it is impossible to
follow. But the <i lang="es">Vocabulario</i> is greatly lauded by the
&ldquo;Visitador,&rdquo; as &ldquo;an eagle in its flight,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;a sun in its brilliancy.&rdquo; It is reported to have added
three thousand new words to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href=
"#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>the vocabulary. The editor himself
is modest enough, and declares he has brought only one drop to a whole
ocean. The work, which had been in many hands, occupied Father Noceda
thirty years, and he allowed no word to pass until &ldquo;twelve
Indians&rdquo; agreed that he had found its true meaning. He would not
take less, for had he broken his rule and diminished the numbers, who
knows, he asks, with what a small amount of authority he might have
satisfied himself? There can be no doubt that to find absolute
synonymes between languages so unlike as the Castilian and the
Tag&aacute;loc was an utterly impossible task, and that the root of a
word of which the editor is in search is often lost in the inflections,
combinations and additions, which surround and involve it, without
reference to any general principle. And after all comes the question,
What is the Tag&aacute;loc language? That of the mountains differs much
from that of the valleys; the idiom of the Comingtang from those of the
Tingues.</p>
<p>The word Tag&aacute;la, sometimes written Tag&aacute;l,
Tag&aacute;lo, or Tag&aacute;loc, I imagine, is derived from <i lang=
"tl">Taga</i>, a native. Taga Majayjay is a native of Majayjay. A good
Christian is called <i lang="tl">Ang manga taga langit</i>, a native of
heaven; and it is a common vituperation to say to a man, &ldquo;Taga
infierno,&rdquo; signifying, &ldquo;You must be a native of
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tag&aacute;l language is not easily acquired. A Spanish proverb
says there must be <i lang="es">un a&ntilde;o de arte y dos di
bahaque</i>&mdash;one year of grammar and two of <i lang=
"tl">bahaque</i>. The <i lang="tl">bahaque</i> is the native dress. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>friars informed me that it required several
years of residence to enable them to preach in Tag&aacute;l; and in
many of the convents intercourse is almost confined to the native
idioms, as there are few opportunities of speaking Spanish.</p>
<p>The blending of nouns and verbs into a single word, and the
difficulty of tracing the roots of either, is one cause of perplexity,
the paucity of words requiring many meanings for the same sound. Thus
<i lang="tl">ayao</i> means, enough, passage of merchandise, dearness,
and is a note of admiration; <i lang="tl">baba</i> signifies brace,
beard, lungs, perchance, abscess; <i lang="tl">bobo</i>, a net, to
melt, to frighten, to spill; <i lang="tl">alangalang</i>, courtesy,
elevation, dignity. Hence, too, the frequent repetitions of the same
word. <i lang="tl">Aboabo</i>, mist; <i lang="tl">alaala</i>, to
remember; <i lang="tl">&ntilde;gala&ntilde;gala</i>, palate; <i lang=
"tl">galagala</i>, bitumen; <i lang="tl">dilidili</i>, doubt; <i lang=
"tl">hasahasa</i>, a fish.</p>
<p>So a prodigious number of Tag&aacute;l words are given to represent
a verb in its various applications, in which it is difficult to trace
any common root or shadow of resemblance. Noceda, for the verb
<i>give</i> (<i>dar</i>, Spanish) has 140 Tag&aacute;l words; for
(<i>meter</i>) <i>put</i>, there are forty-one forms; for
(<i>hacer</i>) <i>do</i>, one hundred and twenty-six. The age of the
moon is represented by twelve forms, in only two of which does the
Tag&aacute;l word for moon occur.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that a language so rude as the
Tag&aacute;l could never become the channel for communicating
scientific or philosophical knowledge. Yet M. Mallat contends that it
is rich, sonorous, expressive, and, if encouraged, would soon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>possess a literature worthy of a place among
that of European nations!</p>
<p>A folio dictionary of the Bisayan and Spanish language, as spoken in
the island of Panay, was published in 1841 (Manila), having been
written by Father Alonzo de Mentrida. The Spanish and Bisayan, by
Father Julian Martin, was published in the following year.</p>
<p>The letters <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>z</i> are wanting,
and the only sound not represented by our alphabet is the
<i>&ntilde;g</i>. The Tag&aacute;la Indians employ the letter <i>p</i>
instead of the <i>f</i>, which they cannot pronounce. <i>Parancisco</i>
for <i>Francisco</i>, <i>palso</i> for <i>falso</i>, <i>pino</i> for
<i>fino</i>, &amp;c. The <i>r</i> is totally unutterable by the
Tag&aacute;los. They convert the letter into <i>d</i>, and subject
themselves to much ridicule from the mistakes consequent upon this
infirmity. The <i>z</i> is supplanted by <i>s</i>, which does not
convey the Castilian sound as represented by our soft <i>th</i>.</p>
<p>In many provinces, however, of Spain, the Castilian pronunciation of
<i>z</i> is not adopted. There is in the Tag&aacute;l no vowel sound
between <i>a</i> and <i>i</i>, such as is represented in Spanish by the
letter <i>e</i>.</p>
<p>In teaching the Tagal alphabet, the word <i>yaou</i>, being the
demonstrative pronoun, is inserted after the letter which is followed
by the vowel <i>a</i>, and the letter repeated, thus:&mdash;<i>Aa
yaou</i> (<i>a</i>), <i>baba yaou</i> (<i>b</i>), <i>caca yaou</i>
(<i>c</i>), <i>dada yaou</i> (<i>d</i>), <i>gaga yaou</i> (<i>g</i>),
<i>haha yaou</i> (<i>h</i>), <i>lala yaou</i> (<i>l</i>), <i>mama
yaou</i> (m), <i>nana yaou</i> (<i>n</i>), <i>&ntilde;ga&ntilde;ga
yaou</i> (<i>&ntilde;g</i>), <i>papa yaou</i> (<i>p</i>), <i>sasa
yaou</i> (<i>s</i>), <i>tata yaou</i> (<i>t</i>), <i>vava yaou</i>
(<i>v</i>). The <i>&ntilde;g</i> is a combination of the Spanish
<i>&ntilde;</i> with <i>g</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222"
href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nouns in Tagal have neither cases, numbers, nor genders. Verbs have
infinitive, present, preterite, past, future, and imperative tenses,
but they are not changed by the personal pronouns. Among other
singularities, it is noted that no active verb can begin with the
letter <i>b</i>. Some of the interjections, and they are very numerous
in the Tagaloc, are of different genders. How sad! addressed to a man,
is <i>paetog!</i> to a woman, <i>paetag!</i></p>
<p>The Tag&aacute;ls employ the second person singular <i lang=
"tl">icao</i>, or <i lang="tl">co</i>, in addressing one another, but
add the word <i lang="tl">po</i>, which is a form of respect. In
addressing a woman the word <i lang="tl">po</i> is omitted, but is
expected to be used by a female in addressing a man. The personal
pronouns follow instead of preceding both verbs and nouns, as <i lang=
"tl">napa aco</i>, I say; <i lang="tl">napa suja</i>, it is good.</p>
<p>One characteristic of the language is that the passive is generally
employed instead of the active verb. A Tagal will not say &ldquo;Juan
loves Maria,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Maria is loved by Juan.&rdquo; Fr. de
los Santos says it is more elegant to employ the active than the
passive verb, but I observe in the religious books circulated by the
friars the general phraseology is, &ldquo;It is said by God;&rdquo;
&ldquo;it is taught by Christ,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Though the Tag&aacute;l is not rich in words, the same expression
having often a great variety of meanings, there is much perplexity in
the construction. The padre Verduga, however, gives a list of several
species of verbs, with modifications of nouns subjected to the rules of
European grammar.</p>
<p>In adopting Spanish words the Tagals frequently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>simplify and curtail them; for example, for
<i>zapato</i> (shoe) they use only <i>pato</i>; <i>Lingo</i> for
Domingo; <i>bavay</i>, <i>caballo</i> (horse). The diminutive of Maria
is <i>Mariangui</i>; whence <i>Angui</i>, the ordinary name for
Mary.</p>
<p>In looking through the dictionary, I find in the language only
thirty-five monosyllables, viz., <i>a</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>an</i>,
<i>ang</i>, <i>at</i>, <i>ay</i>, <i>ca</i> [with thirteen different
meanings&mdash;a numeral (1), a personal pronoun (they), four
substantives (thing, companion, fright, abstract), one verb (to go),
and the rest sundry adjectival, adverbial, and other terms],
<i>cay</i>, <i>co</i>, <i>con</i>, <i>cun</i>, <i>di</i>, <i>din</i>,
<i>ga</i>, <i>ha</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>ma</i> (with
eighteen meanings, among which are four nouns substantive, eight verbs,
and four adjectives), <i>man</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>mo</i>, <i>na</i>,
<i>&ntilde;ga</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>oy</i>, <i>pa</i> (seven meanings),
<i>po</i>, <i>sa</i>, <i>sang</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>sing</i>, <i>ta</i>,
<i>ya</i>, and <i>yi</i>.</p>
<p>Watches are rare among the Indians, and time is not denoted by the
hours of the clock, but by the ordinary events of the day. De Mas gives
no less than twenty-three different forms of language for denoting
various divisions, some longer, some shorter, of the twenty-four hours;
such as&mdash;darkness departs; dawn breaks; light advances (<i lang=
"tl">magumagana</i>); the sun about to rise (<i lang="tl">sisilang na
ang arao</i>); full day (<i lang="tl">arao na</i>); sun risen; hen
laying; (sun) height of axe; height of spear (from the horizon);
midday; sun sinking; sun set (<i lang="tl"><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6903" title="Source: lung mononna">lungmonorna</span></i>); Ave
Maria time; darkness; blackness; children&rsquo;s bed-time; <i lang=
"tl">animas</i> ringing; midnight near; midnight; midnight past
(<i lang="tl">mababao sa <span class="corr" id="xd21e6912" title=
"Source: haling">hating</span> gaby</i>). And the phraseology varies in
different localities. As bell-ringing and clock-striking were
introduced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>by the Spaniards, most of the terms now in use
must have been employed before their arrival.</p>
<p>Repetitions of the same syllable are common both in the Tag&aacute;l
and Bisayan languages. They are not necessarily indicative of a plural
form, but frequently denote sequence or continuation, as&mdash;<i lang=
"tl">lavay lavay</i>, slavery (continued work); <i lang=
"tl">i&ntilde;gili&ntilde;gil</i>, the growl of a dog; <i lang=
"tl">&ntilde;gi&ntilde;giyao &ntilde;gi&ntilde;giyao</i>, the purring
of a cat; <i lang="tl">cococococan</i>, a hen calling her chickens;
<i lang="tl">pocto pocto</i>, uneven, irregular (there is a Devonshire
word, <i>scory</i>, having exactly the same meaning); <i lang=
"tl">timbon timbon</i>, piling up; <i lang="tl">punit punit</i>, rags;
<i lang="tl">a&ntilde;gao a&ntilde;gao</i>, an infinite number;
<i lang="tl">aling aling</i>, changeable; <i lang="tl">caval caval</i>,
uncertain. Some Spanish words are doubled to avoid being confounded
with native sounds; as <i>dondon</i> for <i>don</i>. These repetitions
are a necessary consequence of the small number of primitive words.</p>
<p>Though the poverty of the language is remarkable, yet a great
variety of designations is found for certain objects. Rice, for
example, in the husk is <i lang="tl">palay</i> (Malay, <i lang=
"ms">padi</i>); before transplanting, <i lang="tl">botobor</i>; when
beginning to sprout, <i>buticas</i>; when the ear appears,
<i>basag</i>; in a more advanced stage, <i>maymota</i>; when fully ripe
in ear, <i>bo&ntilde;gana</i>; when borne down by the wind or the
weight of the ear, <i>dayapa</i>; early rice, <i>cavato</i>; sticky
rice, <i>lagquitan</i>; ill-formed in the grain, <i>popong</i>; rice
cleaned but not separated from the husks, <i>loba</i>; clean rice,
<i>bigas</i>; waste rice, <i>binlor</i>; ground rice, <i>digas</i>;
roasted rice, <i>binusa</i>; roasted to appear like flowers,
<i>binuladac</i>; rice paste, <i>pilipig</i>; fricasseed rice,
<i>sinaing</i>; another sort of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"
href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>prepared rice, <i>soman</i>.
There are no less than nineteen words for varieties of the same object.
And so with verbs:&mdash;To tie, <i>tali</i>; to tie round,
<i>lingquis</i>; to tie a belt, <i>babat</i>; to tie the hands,
<i>gapus</i>; to tie a person by the neck, <i>tobong</i>; to tie with a
noose, <i>hasohaso</i>; to tie round a jar, <i>baat</i>; to tie up a
corpse, <i>balacas</i>; to tie the mouth of a purse, <i>pogong</i>; to
tie up a basket, <i>bilit</i>; to tie two sticks together,
<i>pangcol</i>; to tie up a door, <i>gacot</i>; to tie up a bundle (as
of sticks), <i>bigquis</i>; to tie up sheaves of grain, <i>tangcas</i>;
to tie up a living creature, <i>niquit</i>; to tie the planks of a
floor together, <i>gilaguir</i>; a temporary tie, <i>balaguir</i>; to
tie many times round with a knot, <i>balaguil</i>; tight tie,
<i>yaguis</i>; to tie bamboos, <i>dalin</i>; to tie up an article lent,
<i>pa&ntilde;gayla</i>. Of these twenty-one verbs the root of scarcely
any is traceable to any noun substantive. For rice there are no less
than sixty-five words in Bisayan; for bamboo, twenty.</p>
<p>There are numerous names for the crocodile. <i lang="tl">Buaya</i>
conveys the idea of its size from the egg to the full-grown animal,
when he is called <i lang="tl">buayang <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e7102" title="Source: cotoo">totoo</span></i>, a true crocodile.
For gold there are no less than fifteen native designations, which
denote its various qualities.</p>
<p>Juan de Noceda gives twenty-nine words as translations of <i lang=
"es">mirar</i> (to look); forty-two for <i>meter</i> (to put);
seventy-five for <i>menear</i> (to move); but synonymes are with
difficulty found in languages having no affinity, especially when any
abstract idea is to be conveyed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226"
href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p>In family relations the generic word for brother is <i lang=
"tl">colovong</i>; elder brother, <i lang="tl">cacang</i>: if there be
only three, the second is called <i lang="tl">colovong</i>; the third,
<i lang="tl">bongso</i>: but if there be more than three, the second is
named <i lang="tl">sumonor</i>; the third, <i lang="tl">colovong</i>.
Twin brothers are <i lang="tl">cambal</i>. <i lang="tl">Anac</i> is the
generic name for son; an only son, <i lang="tl">bogtong</i>; the
first-born, <i lang="tl">pa&ntilde;ganay</i>; the youngest, <i lang=
"tl">bongso</i>; an adopted son, <i lang="tl">ynaanac</i>. <i lang=
"tl">Magama</i> means father and son united; <i lang=
"tl">magcunaama</i>, father and adopted son; <i lang=
"tl">nagpapaama</i>, he who falsely calls another his father; <i lang=
"tl">pinanamahan</i>, a falsely called father; <i lang="tl">maanac</i>,
father or mother of many children; <i lang="tl">maganac</i>, father,
mother and family of children (of many); <i lang="tl">caanactilic</i>,
the sons of two widowers; <i lang="tl">magca</i>, brothers by
adoption.</p>
<p>A common ironical expression is, <i lang="tl">Catalastasan mo aya
a!</i> (How very clever!)</p>
<p>The Indian name for the head of a <i lang="es">barrio</i>, or
barangay, is <i lang="tl">dato</i>, but the word more commonly used at
present is the Castilian <i lang="es">cabeza</i>; so that now the
Indian generally denominates this native authority <i lang="tl">cabeza
sa bala&ntilde;gay</i>. The Tagal word for the principal locality of a
district is <i lang="tl">doyo</i>, in Castilian, <i lang=
"es">cabazera</i>.</p>
<p>The word <i lang="es">cantar</i> has been introduced for the music
of the Church, but many of the ancient Indian words have been retained,
such as <i lang="tl">Pinanan umbitanan ang patay</i><span class="corr"
id="xd21e7216" title="Not in source">.</span>&mdash;They sing the
death-song; <i lang="tl">dayao</i>, the song of victory; <i lang=

<p>Many Malayan words are to be traced, some in their pure, others in a
corrupted form, not only in the Tagal and Bisayan, but in other idioms
of the Philippines.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7375src" href=

<i lang="tl">ulan</i> for <i lang="ms">udian</i>, rain; and a few
others. The Malay word <i lang="ms">tuan</i>, meaning honourable, and
generally employed to signify the obedience and deference of the
speaker to the person addressed, is mostly used by the Tagals in an
ironical sense. <i lang="tl">Ay touan co!</i> Honourable man indeed!
&ldquo;Do not <i lang="tl">tuan</i> me,&rdquo; is equivalent to,
&ldquo;None of your nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monks have introduced most of the Castilian words of Greek and
Latin origin necessary for the profession of the Catholic faith, or the
celebration of its religious rites, for few of which could any
representatives be found in the aboriginal tongues.</p>
<p>Considering the long possession of many portions of the Philippines
by tribes professing Mahomedanism, the number of current Arabic words
is small: I heard <i>salam</i>, salute; <i>malim</i>, master;
<i>arrac</i>, wine or spirits; <i>arraes</i> for <i>reis</i>, captain.
And among the Mussulmans of Mindanao, <i>Islam</i>, <i>koran</i>,
<i>rassoul</i> (prophet), <i>bismillah</i>, <i>kitab</i>, and other
words immediately connected with the profession of Islamism, were quite
familiar.</p>
<p>The only Chinese word that I found generally in use was
<i>sampan</i>, a small boat, meaning literally three planks.</p>
<p>Many of the sounds in the Tagal are so thoroughly English that they
fell strangely on my ear. <i lang="tl">Toobig</i> is water; and
<i lang="tl">asin</i>, salt, when shouted out to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>Indian servants at table, somewhat startled me,
and I could not immediately find out what was the excess denounced, or
the peccadillo committed. Most of the friars speak the native idioms
with fluency, never preach in any other, and living, as most of them
do, wholly surrounded by the Indian population, and rarely using their
native Spanish tongue, it is not to be wondered at that they acquire
great facility in the employment of the Indian idioms. Most of the
existing grammars and dictionaries were written by ecclesiastics to aid
in the propagation of the Christian doctrine, and small books are
printed (all on religious subjects) for the instruction of the people.
I could not discover that they have any historical records or
traditions brought down from a remote antiquity.</p>
<p>The more my attention has been directed to the study of the idioms
of distant countries, the more I am struck by the absurd fancies and
theories which have obtained so much currency with regard to the
derivation and affinities of languages. The Biscayans firmly hold their
Euscaran idiom to have been the tongue of Adam and Eve in Paradise, and
consequently the universal language of primitive man and the
fountain-head of all others. More than one Cambrian patriot has claimed
the same honour for the Welsh, insisting that all the dialects of the
world have been derived from the Cymri. But it would be hard to prove
that a single word has descended to the present times from the
antediluvian world. Intercourse and commerce seem the only channels
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>through which any portion of the language of any
one nation or tribe has passed into the vocabulary of any other. The
word <i>sack</i> is said to be that of the most general diffusion. A
French writer contends it was the only word preserved at the time of
the Babel confusion of languages, and it was so preserved in order that
the rights of property might be respected in the general anarchy. In
the lower numerals of remote dialects there are many seemingly strange
affinities, which may be attributed to their frequent use in trading
transactions. Savages, having no such designations of their own, have
frequently adopted the higher decimal numbers employed by civilized
nations, of which the extended use of the word <i>lac</i> for 10,000 is
an example. <i>Muster</i>, among trading nations, is, with slight
variations, the almost universally received word for pattern; so the
words <i>account</i>, <i>date</i>, and many similar. How many maritime
terms are derived from the Dutch, how many military from the French,
how many <i>locomotive</i> from the English! The Justinian code has
impregnated all the languages of Europe with phrases taken from the
Roman law. To the Catholic missal may be traced in the idioms of
converted nations almost all their religious phraseology. In the
facilities of combination which the Greek in so high a degree possesses
science has found invaluable auxiliaries. Our colonies are constantly
adding to our stores, and happily there is not (as in France) any
repugnance to the introduction of useful, still less of necessary
words. Bentham used to say that <i>purity</i> of language <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>and
<i>poverty</i> of language were nearly synonymous. It is well for the
interests of knowledge that the English tongue receives without
difficulty new and needful contributions to the ancient stock. The well
of pure English undefiled is not corrupted, but invigorated, by the
streams which have been poured into it from springs both adjacent and
remote. Language must progress with and accommodate itself to the
progress of knowledge, and it is well that a language clear, defined
and emphatic as our own&mdash;derived from many sources, whence its
plasticity and variety&mdash;having much monosyllabic force and
polysyllabic cadence&mdash;condensed and yet harmonious&mdash;should be
the language having now the strongest holds and the widest
extension.</p>
<p>Among the evidences of progress which the world exhibits, not only
is the gradual extinction of the inferior by the advance of the
superior races of man a remarkable fact, but equally striking is the
disappearance of the rude and imperfect idioms, and their supplantation
by the more efficient instruments of advancement and civilization found
in the languages of the cultivated nations. The attempts which have
been made to introduce the phraseology of advanced arts and sciences
into tongues which only represent a low stage of cultivation, have been
lamentably unsuccessful. No appropriate niches can be found in
barbarian temples for the beautiful productions of the refined genius
of sculpture. The coarse garments of the savage cannot be fitly
repaired with the choice workmanship of the gifted artisan. And
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>few benefits can be conceived of more importance
to the well-being of the human family than that the means of oral
intercourse should be extended, and that a few widely spread languages
(if not a universal one, whose introduction may be deemed an utterly
hopeless dream) will in process of time become the efficient instrument
of communication for the whole world.</p>
<p>The poetry of the Tagals is in quantity of twelve syllables. They
have the Spanish asonante, but words are considered to rhyme if they
have the same vowel or the same consonant at a terminal, as
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">In beautiful starlight</p>
<p class="line">Heaven&rsquo;s concave is drest,</p>
<p class="line">And the clouds as they part</p>
<p class="line">Make the brightness more bright.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So <i>stick</i> would rhyme with <i>thing</i>,
<i>knot</i> with <i>rob</i>; and the Indian always chant their verses
when they recite them, which, indeed, is a generally received Asiatic
custom. The San tze King, or three-syllable classic, which is the
universally employed elementary book in the schools of China, is always
sung, and the verse and music naturally aid the memory. The music of
the song sung by the Tag&aacute;las to tranquillize children, called
the <i>helehele</i>, De Mas says, resembles that of the Arab.</p>
<p>I have found a few proverbs in verse, of which these are

<h2 class="main">NATIVE PRODUCE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i lang="es">Leyes de Indias</i> emphatically
recognize the wrongs and injuries of which the Indians are constantly
the victims, and seek to furnish remedies against them: they annul
dishonest contracts&mdash;they order the authorities rigorously to
punish acts of oppression&mdash;they declare that the transactions of
the Spanish settlers have frequently been &ldquo;the ruin of the
Indians&rdquo;&mdash;they point out the mischiefs produced by the
avarice in some cases, and inaction in others, of the mestizos, who are
commonly the go-betweens in bargains of colonists with natives. The
local <i lang="es">ordenanzas</i>, which are numerous and elaborate,
have for their object to assure to the Indian the fruits of his
labours&mdash;to protect him against his own imprudence and the
usurious exactions of those to whom he applies in his difficulties;
they provide against the usurpation of his lands, declare the sovereign
the rightful owner of property which there are no heirs to claim, and
insist that everywhere the Indian shall draw from the soil he
cultivates the means of comfortable subsistence: the accumulation of
properties acquired from the Indians <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>by ecclesiastical
bodies is prohibited, notwithstanding which prohibition enormous
estates are held by the monkish fraternities. There are also
arrangements for setting apart &ldquo;common lands&rdquo; for general
use, independently of private estates. Many of the provisions are of so
vague a character as to insure their non-observance, and others so
particular and special in their requirements as to make their
enforcement impossible. The 71st article, for example, compels the
Indians &ldquo;to plant useful trees, suited to the
soil&rdquo;&mdash;to sow wheat, rice, maize, vegetables, cotton,
pepper, &amp;c., in proper localities&mdash;to maintain &ldquo;every
species of appropriate cattle&rdquo;&mdash;to have &ldquo;fruits
growing in their gardens and orchards round their
houses&rdquo;&mdash;to keep &ldquo;at least twelve hens and one
cock&rdquo; (a very superfluous piece of legislation), and one
&ldquo;female sucking pig;&rdquo; they must be encouraged to
manufacture cloths and cordage; and failing in these duties for the
space of two years, they are to lose their lands, which, by public
proclamation, shall be appropriated to others. There is, in fact, no
absolute territorial right of property among the Indians. It can always
be seized and reappropriated by the Spanish authorities. Lands are held
on condition that they are cultivated. There are lands possessed by
Spaniards and by corporations of the clergy principally, which pay a
nominal rental to the crown, but the rental is so small as to be of no
account. There is no difficulty in obtaining gratuitous concessions of
territorial surface on the sole obligation of bringing it into
cultivation. Long usage and long possession <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>have
no doubt created supposed rights, which are able to maintain themselves
even against competing private claims or the obvious requirements of
public utility. Questions arise as to what is meant by
&ldquo;cultivation,&rdquo; and the country is full of controversies and
lawsuits, of which land is generally the subject-matter. The larger
proprietors constantly speak of the difficulty of obtaining continuous
labour&mdash;of the necessity of perpetual advances to the
peasant&mdash;of the robbery of the ripe harvests when raised. Hence
they are accustomed to underlet their lands to petty cultivators, who
bring small and unsatisfactory returns to the owners and to the market.
They complain of the jealousy and ill-will of the Indians, their
intrigues and open resistance to foreign settlers, and of the too
indulgent character of the &ldquo;Law of the Indies.&rdquo; It appears
to me that there is abundant field for advantageous agricultural
experiments, not perhaps so much in the immediate vicinity of large and
populous places, as on the vast tracts of uncared-for territory, which
demand nothing but attention and capital, perseverance and knowledge,
to render a prodigal return. No doubt the agriculturist should have
possession absolutely and irrevocably secured to him. Once installed by
the government he must be protected against all molestation of his
title. I do not believe in the invincible inertness of the Indians when
they are properly encouraged. I heard of a native in one of the most
distant villages I visited in Pinay, who had been recommended by a
friar to take to sugar-growing. He did so, and obtained five
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>hundred dollars for the produce which he, for
the first time, took down to Iloilo. He will get a thousand the second
year; and others were following his example. A little additional labour
produces so much that the smallest impulse gives great results,
especially where employed over a vast extent. But Indian indolence is
not only prejudicial from the little assistance it offers to
agricultural activity in preparing, sowing, watching and gathering the
harvest; it is unable to furnish any of those greater appliances which
must be considered rather of public than of private concern. Hence the
absence of facilities for irrigation, the imperfect state of the river
navigation, the rarity of canals, the badness of the roads in so many
localities. The seasons bring their floods, and the mountain torrents
create their gullies; but the water escapes into the sea, and the
labourer brings his produce, as best he may, amidst the rocks and sand
and mud which the cataracts have left behind them. I have seen beasts
of burden struggling in vain to extricate themselves, with their loads,
from the gulf into which they had fallen, and in which they were
finally abandoned by their conductors. I have been carried to populous
places in palanquins, whose bearers, sometimes sixteen in number, were
up to their thighs amidst mire, slough, tangled roots, loose stones and
fixed boulders. De Mas says that the labourer absorbs three-fifths of
the gross produce, leaving two-fifths to the proprietor and capitalist;
but the conditions of labour are so very various that it is difficult
to reach any general <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span>conclusion, beyond the undoubted fact that
neither capitalist nor labourer receives anything like the amount of
profit which, under a better system, would be enjoyed by both; that the
cost is far greater, and the returns far smaller, than they should be;
and that the common prosperity suffers from the position of each.
Whatever may be said of the enervating effects of climate and the want
of motive to give activity to industry, it is probable that all
nations, even the most industrious and the most opulent, have passed
through their stages of indolence and inactivity. China affords an
example that climate alone is no insuperable barrier to energetic
exertions in all departments of the field of production, and that the
possession of much is no necessary check upon the desire of obtaining
and enjoying more. The value of lands is very various. De Mas says that
the <i lang="es">qui&ntilde;on</i> (of 1,000 square fathoms), in
Pangasinan, sells for from 220 to 250 dollars; in the Laguna, 250 to
300; in Ilocos Sur, 300; in the neighbourhood of Manila, 1,000. He
seems to consider sugar as, on the whole, the most profitable
investment. He gives several tables of the cost and charges of sundry
tropical productions, but the many elements of uncertainty, the cost of
raising, the vicissitudes of climate, the attacks of insects, the
fluctuations in the amount and value of accessible labour, and all the
ebbs and flows of supply and demand, make all calculations only
approximative. His <i lang="es">apuntes</i>, however, are well worth
consulting by those interested in detailed inquiry. He gives as a
result of rice cultivation a minimum profit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>of
24 per cent., a maximum profit of 76 per cent. per annum. This would
seem sufficiently inviting, especially as the Spaniards are reported to
be fonder of agriculture than of any other pursuit, and fonder of being
owners of lands than of any other property, according to their old
refrain:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;No vessel on the sea,</p>
<p class="line">But the house that&rsquo;s mine for me,</p>
<p class="line">And all the lands around which I&rsquo;ve been used to
see.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7726src" href="#xd21e7726" name=
"xd21e7726src">1</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Indigo will render, according to De Mas, 100 per cent.
Coffee, on the same authority, will double its capital in four years.
Cocoa returns 90 per cent. Attempts to introduce mulberry cultivation
for silk have had little success, though the specimens sent to Europe
have obtained prizes for their excellent quality. The worms require a
more continuous attention than the Indians are willing to give, and the
same may be said of those spices, nutmegs, cinnamon, and any produce
which demands unremitting care. The spontaneous productions of the
Philippines do not easily obtain the benefit of a more enlightened mode
of culture.</p>
<p>The rights of property require thorough investigation and
recognition in a country which has not been surveyed or cadastred;
where the foreign population is migratory and uncertain; where
documentary titles are, for the most part, wanting, and appropriation
of the soil has been little controlled by the supreme authorities;
where there is no land-tax, and the religious bodies hold immense
territories generally underlet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240"
href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>to the natives. The smallness
of estates necessarily adds to the cost of production, and it would not
be easy to induce wealthy capitalists to settle unless facilities were
given for the acquisition and cultivation of extensive properties. Such
capitalists would introduce the improvements in agricultural science
which are now wholly wanting; they would bring with them able heads and
hands to conduct, and better instruments to give practical effect to
superior knowledge. A desire is frequently expressed for the formation
of agricultural societies, but these are rather the children than the
parents of progress, and the numerous and respectable body which
already exists in Manila, the &ldquo;<span lang="es">Sociedad
Economica</span>,&rdquo; has not been instrumental in introducing any
very important changes. There is in the Spanish mind too great a
disposition to look to &ldquo;authority&rdquo; as the source and
support of all reforms; but the best service of authority in almost all
cases of productive industry is non-interference and inaction; it is
not the meddling with, but the leaving matters alone, that is wanted;
it is the removal of restrictions, the supersession of laws which
profess to patronize and protect, but whose patronage and protection
mean the sacrifice of the many to the few. Government, no doubt, can
greatly assist the public weal by the knowledge it can collect and
distribute. Nothing is more desirable than that the rich territorial
capabilities of the Philippines should be thoroughly explored by
efficient scientific inquiry. Geologists, chemists, mechanicians,
botanists, would teach us much respecting the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>raw
materials of these multitudinous islands, so inviting to the explorer,
and so little explored. Mountains, forests, plains, lakes, rivers,
solicit the investigation, which they could not fail to reward.</p>
<p>Of the indigenous productions found by the Spaniards the dry
mountain rice seems to have been the principal article cultivated by
the Indians for food, the arts of irrigation being little known, and
the mode of culture of the simplest character. The missionaries taught
the Indians to divide their lands, to improve their agriculture, to
store their harvests, and generally to meliorate their condition by
more knowledge and foresight. Maize and wheat were introduced from
America, though for a long time the use of wheaten bread was confined
to the service of the mass. There is now an adequate supply for the
wants of the consumer. Melons, water-melons and various fruits, peas,
pumpkins, onions, cucumbers, garlic and other vegetables, soon found
their way from Mexico to the church gardens, and thence to more
extensive cultivation. Coffee sprang up wild in the island of Luzon,
ungathered by the natives. Tobacco was introduced under the patronage
of the government, and is become the most important source of revenue.
Pepper and cassia grew unnoticed, but the cocoa-nut tree and the
plantain were among the most precious of the Indian&rsquo;s
possessions, and the areca was not less valued. Indigo was indigenous,
and the wild cotton-tree was uncared for; nor can it be other than a
subject of regret that to the present hour so inadequate an attention
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>has been paid to the natural production of the
islands, and means so little efficient taken for improving their
quality or extending their cultivation. At the present time there are
few large estates having the benefit of well-directed labour and
sufficient capital. Of those possessed by the religious communities
little can be expected in the way of agricultural improvement, but the
cultivated lands are generally in the hands of small native
proprietors. Where the labourer is hired, his daily pay is from a half
rial to a rial and a half (3&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i>), varying
in the different provinces.</p>
<p>The <i>qui&ntilde;on</i> is the ordinary measure of land; it is
divided into 10 <i>baletas</i>, these into 100 <i>loanes</i>, which
represent 31,250 Castilian varas. Three labourers are supposed
sufficient for the cultivation of a qui&ntilde;on. In 1841 the
Captain-General Urbiztondo published a decree encouraging the
importation of Chinese agricultural labourers by landed proprietors,
and with a special view to the cultivation of sugar, indigo and hemp.
The decree was expected to produce a beneficial revolution&mdash;it has
been a dead letter. Imported labour, subject to all sorts of
restrictions, cannot in the long run compete with free indigenous
labour. The question is a very grave one in its ramifications and
influence on colonial interests, when they come into the field against
the free trade and the free labour of the competing world. I doubt
altogether the powers of the West Indies&mdash;dependent upon imported
and costly immigrants&mdash;to rival the rich fields of the East, when
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>capital and activity shall turn to account their
feracious soil, more genial climate, and more economical means of
production. Progress there is but the natural development of the
elements which Providence has allotted to them, whereas in the West
India colonies everything is forced and unnatural, purchased at an
immense cost and maintained by constant sacrifices. <span class=

<p class="first">The money value of the tobacco grown in the
Philippines is estimated at from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 of dollars, say
1,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling. Of this nearly one half is consumed in the
islands, one-quarter is exported in the form of cheroots (which is the
Oriental word for cigars), and the remainder sent to Spain in leaves
and cigars, being estimated as an annual average <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e7773" title="Source: conribution">contribution</span> exceeding
800,000 dollars. The sale of tobacco is a strict government monopoly,
but the impossibility of keeping up any efficient machinery for the
protection of that monopoly is obvious even to the least observant. The
cultivator, who is bound to deliver all his produce to the government,
first takes care of himself and his neighbours, and secures the best of
his growth for his own benefit. Out of the capital of Manila scarcely
anything is smoked but the <i lang="es">cigarro ilegitimo</i>; and in
the capital you frequently get a hint that &ldquo;the weed&rdquo; is
not from the <i lang="es">estanco real</i>. From functionaries able to
obtain the <i>best</i> which the government brings to market, a present
is often volunteered, which shows that they avail themselves
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=

in discussing the matter with the most intelligent of the <i lang=

the manufacturer and the seller, and the establishment of a simple
duty, would be more productive to the revenue than the present
vexatious and inefficient system of privilege.</p>

<p>Since when the produce has more than quadrupled in value.</p>
<p>In 1810 the deliveries were 50,000 bales (of two arrobas), of which
Gapan furnished 47,000, and Cagayan 2,000. In 1841 Cagayan furnished
170,000 bales; Gapan, 84,000; and New Biscay, 34,000. But the produce
is enormously increased; and so large is the native consumption, of
which a large proportion pays no duty, that it would not be easy to
make even an approximative estimate of the extent and value of the
whole tobacco harvest. Where the fiscal authorities are so scattered
and so corrupt;&mdash;where communications are so imperfect and
sometimes wholly interrupted;&mdash;where large tracts of territory are
in the possession of tribes unsubdued or in a state of imperfect
subjection;&mdash;where even among the more civilized Indians the
rights of property <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246"
name="pb246">246</a>]</span>are rudely defined, and civil authority
imperfectly maintained;&mdash;where smuggling, though it may be
attended with some risk, is scarcely deemed by anybody an offence, and
the very highest functionaries themselves smoke and offer to their
guests contraband cigars, on account of their superior
quality,&mdash;it may well be supposed that lax laws, lax morals and
lax practices, harmonize with each other, and that such a state of
things as exists in the Philippines must be the necessary, the
inevitable result. It is sufficient to look at the cost of the raw
material and the value of the manufactured article to perceive what an
enormous margin of profit there exists. A quintal of tobacco will

<p>Cheroots (cigars) are manufactured in two forms,&mdash;that of the
Havana, the smaller end being twisted to a point,&mdash;or cut at both
ends, the usual Manila form. They are of sundry qualities, as
follows:&mdash;Largest size, 125 to a box&mdash;1st Regalias, 1st
Caballeros and Londres; second size, 250 to a box&mdash;2nd Regalias
and 1st Cortados, 2nd Caballeros, 1st Havanas (ordinary size, and such

<p>Upon these minimum prices biddings take place at the monthly public
auctions. So large is the demand that it is difficult to obtain any but
fresh cigars, which require to be kept for two or three years to
ripen.</p>
<p>The collection of tobacco and the manufacture of cigars are under
the charge of an administration whose head-quarters are in Manila. The
warehouses are of immense extent, and 20,000 persons probably find
occupation in the preparation of this article of luxury, to say nothing
of those employed in its production. The provinces in which there are
establishments for the collection are Cagayan, La Isabela, New Ecija,
La Union, Abra and Cayan. The largest of the manufactures of cigars are
in Binondo (Manila) and Cavite, in the province of the same name.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>Fr. Blanco thus describes the <i lang="la">Nicotiana tabacum</i> of
the Philippines: &ldquo;It is an annual, growing to the height of a
fathom, and furnishes the tobacco for the <i lang="es">estancos</i>
(licensed shops). Here, as everywhere else, its quality and taste vary.
General opinion prefers the tobacco of Gapan, but that of the Pasy
districts, Laglag and Lambunao, in Iloilo, of Maasin or Leyte, is
appreciated for its fine aroma; also that of Cagayan, after being kept
for some years,&mdash;for otherwise, like the tobacco of the island of
Negros, it burns the mouth. It is a narcotic, and will subdue recent
tumours. It is salutary when smoked, and even a necessity in these
regions; it disperses phlegm, protects from the bad consequences of
humidity and the morning dews, and is only injurious to health when
used in excess. Snuff relieves from headaches and disperses gloomy
humours. A small piece of smoked tobacco at the end of a stick applied
to the nose of the lizard, which is here called the <i>chacon</i>
(probably the ghiko), causes its instant death. A cruel
practice,&rdquo; (adds the father), &ldquo;for the reptile is most
useful, destroying cockroaches, centipedes, mice and other vermin;
besides which its song may cheer the timid, who believe that while that
song lasts there will be no earthquakes nor any excess of
rain.&rdquo;&mdash;(Pp. 74&ndash;75.)</p>
<p>I am informed by the alcalde mayor of Cagayan that he sent last year
(1858) to Manila from that province tobacco for no less a value than
2,000,000 dollars. The quality is the best of the Philippines; it is
all forwarded in leaf to the capital. He speaks of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>the
character of the Indians with great admiration, and says acts of
dishonesty are very rare among them, and that property is conveyed in
perfect safety through the province. The quantity of leaf transmitted
was 300,000 bales, divided into seven qualities, of which the prices
paid were from two to seven rials per quintal, leaving a large margin
of profit. The tobacco used by the natives is not subject to the
estanco, and on my inquiring as to the cost of a cigar in Cagayan, the
answer was, &ldquo;Casi nada&rdquo; (Almost nothing). They are not so
well rolled as those of the government, but undoubtedly the raw
material is of the very best.</p>
<p>The demand for the important article of coffee in Australia and
California will probably hereafter be largely supplied from the Spanish
archipelago. Of the mode of cultivation, there is nothing particularly
characteristic of the Philippines. The ground having been cleared
(where on a large extent, by fire), it is fenced in, the soil prepared,
and after having been steeped in water for two or three days, the
sprouts are stuck into the holes which had been made for their
reception, and in the following year are ready for cutting. The use of
the plough largely increases the produce. The cultivation of sugar is
rapidly extending. The harvest takes place generally from March to May.
Four groups of labourers are employed: the cutters and the carters in
the field, the grinders and the boilers in the manufactory.
Improvements are gradually being introduced, as larger capitalists and
more intelligent cultivators <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href=
"#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>come forward; and the
establishment of refineries now in progress will induce many beneficial
changes. Much of the clayed sugar which I saw delivered at Manila for
refining into loaves had rather the appearance of dirty mud than of a
valuable commodity. Though slowly, the work of improvement goes on, and
there could be no greater evidence of it than the presence of a number
of Chinese employed in the various stages of the fabric. Nor do these
Chinese labourers fail to bring with them much practical knowledge.
They are mostly from Fokien, a province in which the production of
sugar is great, and in which there are large sugar refineries, mostly,
however, for the manufacture of sugar-candy, which is the form in which
the Chinese usually purchase the sugar for consumption, pounding it
into powder. I visited several extensive establishments at
Chang-chow-foo, about thirty miles from Amoy, a port whence the
exportation is large.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of the sugar-cane. The <i>zambales</i>
is used principally as food; the <i>encarnado</i> (red), <i>morada</i>
(purple), <i>blanca</i> (white), and <i>listada</i> (striped), give the
syrup for manufacture. The planting of the sprouts takes place between
February and May. Weeds are removed by ploughing, and the plants ripen
in ten or twelve months. In some provinces crops are cultivated for
three successive years; in others, the soil is allowed to rest an
intermediate year, and maize or other produce grown. When cut, the
canes are carried to mills called by the natives <i>cabayavan</i>, to
be crushed. The mills consist of two <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>cylindrical stones
with teeth of the <i>molave</i> wood; a buffalo turns the wheel and the
juice is conveyed to the boilers. The improvements of the West are
being slowly introduced, and sundry economical processes have been
adopted. Increasing demand, extended cultivation and, above all, the
application of larger capitals and greater activity, will, undoubtedly,
make the Philippines one of the great producing countries. A variety of
tables have been printed, showing that the average annual profits on
coffee cultivation are from 20 to 30 per cent.; in some provinces
considerably more.</p>
<p>Rice being of far more general production, is estimated to give an
average yearly profit of from 12 to 20 per cent.; sesame returns an
average of about 20 per cent.; cocoa-nuts may be considered at about
equal to rice in the yearly benefits they leave, but the conditions are
so various that it may be difficult to generalize. It may, however, be
asserted with tolerable certainty, that money employed with ordinary
prudence in agricultural investments will give an interest of from 20
to 30 per cent.</p>
<p>The consumption of rice is universal, and the superfluity of the
harvests is taken to the Chinese markets. The varieties of rice have
been elsewhere spoken of, but they may be classed under the two general
heads of water and mountain rice. The aquatic rice is cultivated as in
Europe and America; the sowing of the dry rice usually precedes that of
the water rice, and takes place at the end of May. It is usually
broadcast on the hills, requires to be hoed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>and
weeded, and is ripened in from three to four months and a half. It is
harvested ear by ear.</p>
<p>Fr. Blanco describes four species of water-cultivated (<i lang=
"es">de agua</i>), and five of mountain-produced (<i>secano</i>) rice.
Of the first class, the <i>lamuyo</i> (<i lang="la">Oryza sativa
lamuyo</i>) is principally cultivated, especially in Batangas. The
barbed rice (<i lang="la">Oryza aristata</i>) grows in Ilocos. Of the
mountain rice, that called <i>quinanda</i> (<i lang="la">Oryza sativa
quinanda</i>) is the most esteemed. The cultivation of the water rice
begins by the preparation of the seed deposits (<i>semillero</i>), into
which, at the beginning of the rainy season, the seed is thrown, after
a thorough impregnation of the ground with water, of which several
inches remain on the surface. Ploughing and harrowing produce a mass of
humid mud. During the growth of the seed, irrigation is continued, and
after six weeks the crops are ready for transplanting to the
rice-fields. Men generally pull up the plants, and convey them to the
fields, where women up to their knees in mire separate the plants, and
place them in holes at a regular distance of about five inches from one
another. They are left for some days to take root, when the grounds are
again irrigated. The rice grows to the height of somewhat more than a
yard, and after four months is ready for harvest. It is a common usage
to cut every ear separately with an instrument whose Indian name is
<i>yatap</i>. In some parts a sickle called a <i>lilit</i> is used. The
lilit has a crook by which a number of ears are collected, and being
grasped with the left hand, are cut by the serrated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>blade of the sickle held in the right hand. The
crops of aquatic rice vary from thirty to eightyfold.</p>
<p>The mountain rice is sown broadcast after ploughing and harrowing,
and buffaloes are employed to trample the seed into the ground. More
care is sometimes taken, and holes made at regular distances, into
which three or four grains of rice are dropped. Careful cultivation and
great attention to the removal of weeds are said to produce
hundred-fold crops.</p>
<p>It is stated by Father Blanco that a third of the rice harvest has
been known to perish in consequence of the dilatory and lazy way in
which the reaping is conducted.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Philippines offer great facilities for
the cultivation of indigo, but it has been neglected and inadequate
attention paid to the manufacture. The growers state that there is in
Europe a prejudice against Manila indigo; but such prejudice can only
be the result of experience, and would be removed by greater care on
the part of the growers, manufacturers and exporters. The crops,
however, are uncertain, and often seriously damaged or destroyed by
tempestuous weather, and by invasions of caterpillars. The seed is
broadcast, sown immediately after the temperate season. It grows
rapidly, but requires to have the weeds which spring up with it cleared
away. It is ready for harvesting in the rainy months, generally in
June. The fermentation, straining, beating, cleaning, pressing, and
final preparation are carried on, not according to the improved
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>processes of British India, but as they were
introduced by the Spaniards. The Indians, like the Chinese, employ the
dye in its liquid state.</p>
<p>The consumption of the betel root is incredibly great. There are in
the city of Manila, in the courts and ground floors of the houses,
altogether 898 warehouses and shops, of which 429 (or nearly half the
whole) are devoted to the sale of the prepared betel, or to the
materials of which it is composed. There are two warehouses where the
leaf in which the areca nut is wrapped is sold wholesale; there are 105
retail shops for the same article, and there are 308 shops in which is
sold for immediate use the nut mixed with shell-lime, and served with
the <i>buyo</i> (leaf of the piper betel), ready for conveyance to the
mouth of the consumer, to whom it is from usage become an article of
necessity even more urgent than the rice he eats or the water he
drinks.</p>
<p>Of the areca, Fr. Blanco, in his <i lang="es">Flora de
Filipinas</i>, gives the following account:&mdash;&ldquo;This species
of palm, with which everybody is acquainted, and which like its fruit
is called <i>bonga</i> by the Indians, grows to about the average
height of the cocoa-nut tree. Its trunk is smaller at the base than the
top, very straight, with many circular rings formed by the junction of
the leaves before they fall, which they do on growing to a certain
size. The use of the nut, which is somewhat smaller than a hen&rsquo;s
egg, is well known. When the bonga is wanting, the Indians employ the
bark of the guava, or of the antipolo (<i>Artocarpus</i>). Mixed with
lime and the pepper leaf, it makes the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>saliva red. The
Indians apply this saliva to the navel of their children as a cure for
the colic and a protection from the effects of cold air. When ripe, the
fruit is red and, I believe, might be used as a red dye. With copperas
it makes a black dye, but inferior to that of the aroma. The lower part
of the leaves, called <i>talupac</i>, is very clean, broad, white and
flexible, making excellent wrappers and serving many useful purposes.
The sprouts are salted and eaten, and are agreeable to the taste, but
when cut the tree perishes.&rdquo;&mdash;(P. 495.)</p>
<p>Father Blanco says of the piper betel (<i lang="la">Pimenta
betel</i>), whose leaves are employed as envelopes to the areca nut and
lime:&mdash;&ldquo;This plant is universally known, in consequence of
the immense consumption of the betel, or <i>buyo</i>, as the betel is
called by the Spaniards. The betel of Pasay, near Manila, is much
esteemed; that of Banang, in Batangas, is the best of that province,
and probably superior to the betel of Pasay. The tree prefers a
somewhat sandy soil, but if too sandy, as in Pasay, fish is used as a
manure, or the rind of the <i>Ajonjoli</i> (sesame), or other
oleaginous fruits. The tree must be frequently watered. The roots are
renovated after a year, but if left to grow old they produce flowers
like the litlit (<i lang="la">Piper obliquum</i>). The fruit is called
by the natives <i>poro</i>. Of the <i lang="la">Piper parvifolium</i>,
an inebriating liquor is made. The Indians use the leaves as a
preservative against the cholera. All the species of <i lang=
"la">Piper</i> are useful against the poison of snakes. The wound is
first scarified, and either the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256"
href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>juice or bruised leaves of
the plant applied and frequently changed. &lsquo;I was called,&rsquo;
says the author of the <i>Flora of the Antilles</i>, &lsquo;to a negro
whose thigh had just been bitten by a snake. The poison had made
frightful progress. All the remedies of art had been employed in vain.
A negro appeared, and asked leave to apply the popular mode of cure.
There was then no hope of the recovery of the patient&mdash;human life
was at stake&mdash;I did not hesitate. In a few moments the progress of
the poison was stopped by the simple application of the <i lang=
"la">Piper procumbens</i>. On the third application the cure was
completed.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;(Pp. 16, 17.)</p>
<p>Of the vegetation of the Philippines, the bamboo may be deemed the
most extensive, the most useful, and the most beautiful. The graceful
groups of <i lang="es">Ca&ntilde;as</i> (the Spanish name, the
Tag&aacute;l is <i lang="tl">Bocaui</i>) are among the most charming
decorations of the island scenery, and are scattered with great
profusion and variety on the sides of the streams and rivers, on hills
and plains, and always to be found adjacent to the residence of the
native. Waving their light branches at the smallest breeze, they give
perpetual life to the landscape, while they are of daily service to the
people. The <i lang="la">Bambus arundo</i> grows to a great height, and
its cane is sometimes more than eight inches in diameter. In it is
sometimes found a small stone, called <i>Tabaxir</i>, to which the
Indians attribute miraculous healing virtues. The <i lang="la">Bambus
lumampao</i> and the <i>lima</i> are so hard that the wood is used for
polishing brass. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257"
name="pb257">257</a>]</span>The bamboo serves for an infinity of uses;
from the food that nourishes man or beast, to the weapons that destroy
his life: for the comforts of home; for the conveniences of travel; for
the construction of bridges, several hundred feet in length, over which
heavy artillery can safely pass; for shipping and cordage; for shelter,
and for dwellings and domestic utensils of all sorts; for vessels of
every size to retain, and tubes to convey, water and other fluids; for
mats, palings, and scaffoldings; for musical instruments, even organs
for churches; for a hundred objects of amusement; and, indeed, for all
the purposes of life the bamboo is distinguished. It is the raw
material on which the rude artist makes his experiments&mdash;roots,
trunks, branches, leaves, all are called into the field of utility.
There is much of spontaneous production, but it may be multiplied by
layers and cuttings. Some of the bamboos grow to an enormous size. That
called by the natives <i lang="tl">cauayang totoo</i>, and by the
Spaniards <i lang="es">ca&ntilde;a espino</i>, reaches the height of
from forty to fifty feet, the diameter of the stalk or trunk exceeding
eight inches. One of its divisions will sometimes hold two pecks of
wheat. An infusion of this bamboo is poisonous to deer; but its leaves
are eaten by horses and cattle and its young shoots as salad by man.
The <i lang="tl">cauayang quiling</i> (<i lang="es">ca&ntilde;a
macho</i> of the Spaniards) grows to about forty feet in height, its
stem being of the size of a man&rsquo;s arm. From the thickness of the
rind and the smallness of the hollow, it is the strongest of the
bamboos, and is used for carrying burdens on the shoulders; a fourth
part <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>of the whole cane, of the length of two yards,
when split, will support any weight that a man can carry. The cane has
an elasticity which lightens the burden to the bearer. The varieties of
the bamboo are scarcely to be counted. The interior of the <i>osin</i>
gives a white substance, which is used as a cure for urinal and eye
diseases.</p>
<p>I once heard a remark that the Crystal Palace itself could have been
filled with specimens of various applications of the bamboo. Minus the
glass, the palace itself might have been constructed of this material
alone, and the protecting police furnished from it with garments, hats
and instruments of punishment. The living trees would fill a
conservatory with forms and colours of wondrous variety and beauty; and
if paintings and poetry, in which the bamboo takes a prominent place,
were allowed, not the walls of the Louvre could be sufficient for the
pictures and the scrolls.</p>
<p>The various classes of canes, rattans and others of the
<i>Calamus</i> family, have a great importance and value. The
<i>palasan</i> is frequently three hundred feet long, and in Mindanao
it is said they have been found of more than treble that length. They
are used for cords and cables; but as the fibres are susceptible of
divisions, down to a very fine thread, they are woven into delicate
textures, some of which, as in the case of hats and cigar-cases, are
sold at enormous prices. If not exposed to damp, the fibres are very
enduring, and are safe from the attacks of the weevil.</p>
<p>The native name for hemp is <i>anabo</i>, the Spanish, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span><i>ca&ntilde;amo</i>; but the raw material known
in commerce as Manila hemp, is called in the Philippines by its Indian
name, <i>abac&aacute;</i>. It is become a very important article of
export, and in the year 1858 no less than 25,000 tons were shipped for
foreign countries from Manila alone. Of this quantity Great Britain
received about one-fourth, and the greater portion of the remainder
went to the United States. Next to sugar and tobacco, it ranks highest
in the list of exported produce. It is employed not only for cordage,
but for textile fabrics. It is the fibre of one of the plantain
family&mdash;the <i lang="la">Musa trogloditarum textoria</i>. Dampier
says that its growth is confined to the island of Mindanao; but the
quantity there grown is, at the present time, trifling compared to the
production of Luzon, Panay, and other islands of the archipelago. The
finer qualities are in considerable demand for weaving, and these are,
of course, subjected to a more elaborate manipulation. It readily
receives red and blue dyes; the <i>morinda</i> and <i>marsdenia</i>,
native plants, being employed for the purpose. The fruit is said to be
edible, but I am not aware of ever having seen it introduced, nor would
it be likely to compete with the best of the delicious plantains which
the Philippines produce. Father Blanco says that of these there are no
less than fifty-seven varieties. The native name is <i>saguing</i>.
Curious traditions are connected with this fruit. The Arabs say it was
introduced into the world by Allah, when the Prophet lost his teeth,
and could no longer enjoy the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>date. It is sometimes called
Adam&rsquo;s apron, on the supposition that it was the plant whose
leaves he and Eve employed to cover their nakedness. Its use is
universal, both in its natural state and cooked in various forms.</p>
<p>The cultivation of Coffee might be largely extended. For that, and
indeed for every tropical produce, there is scarcely a limit to the
unappropriated lands well suited to their production. Some of the
coffee is of excellent quality, scarcely distinguishable from that of
Arabia, but the general character is less favourable.</p>
<p>Indeed there is an obvious contrast between the great improvements
which have taken place in the Dutch archipelago, the British colonies,
Ceylon for example, and the stagnation created by the too stationary
habits of the Indian producer. He is little attentive to the proper
selection of soil, the temperature or elevation of the ground, the
choice of the seed, the pruning of the tree, the care of the berry, the
separation of the outer coatings, and other details, which may help to
account for the comparatively small extension of coffee production,
especially considering the enormously increased demand for the article,
and the prodigious development of its cultivation in Netherlands India,
Ceylon and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The quality of the Cocoa is excellent, and I have nowhere tasted
better chocolate than in the Philippines, but the tree is principally
planted for the private use of its possessors. In the convents
particularly, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>the friars are proud of their chocolate, which
is generally made under their own superintendence, and from fruit
raised in their own grounds and gardens. A little attention is required
in the selection of soil and locality; the fruit is gathered as it
ripens, and after the removal of the cuticle simply requires to be
sun-dried.</p>
<p>It is sown in the month of November, and the shade of the banana is
sought for its protection. The cocoa of Zebu is reported to be equal in
excellence to that of the Caracas. In the island of Negros there is a
large spontaneous production. The Indian soaks the cocoa in sugar
juice, and in many parts the beverage is taken twice a day.</p>
<p>The supply of Cotton is one of the most interesting of questions as
regards our manufacturing population, and I have felt surprised at the
small sagacity, the <i lang="la">parva sapientia</i>, which has been
exhibited by many who have devoted their attention to the matter. The
expectation that <i>Negroland</i> Africa will be able to fill up the
anticipated <i>vacuum</i> of supply is a vain hope originating in
ignorance of the character and habits of the native races, and it will
end in disappointment and vexation. The capabilities of British India
are great, and the elements of success are there; but the capabilities
of China are vastly greater, and I believe that as in two or three
years China was able to send raw silk to the value of ten millions
sterling into the market, and immediately to make up for the absence of
the European supply, so to China we may hereafter look for a boundless
supply of raw cotton; she now clothes more than <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>three hundred and fifty millions of her people
from her own cotton-fields. The prices in China are so nearly on a
level with those of India that though they allow an importation to the
yearly value of two or three millions sterling in the southern
provinces of China, importations into the northern are scarcely known.
The quality, the modes of cultivation, of cleaning, of packing, are all
susceptible of great improvements; their interests will make the
Chinese teachable, and the Yang-tse-Kiang may be the channel for the
solution of the cotton difficulty.</p>
<p>There seems no sufficient reason why cotton wool should not have
been more largely exported from the Philippines. It is cheaply produced
and might follow the crops of mountain rice. There is a domestic
demand, and that seems to satisfy the grower, for cotton has almost
ceased to be an article of foreign trade. The staple is said to be
short. The plant is an annual and produces its crop in two or three
months after it is sown. It is gathered in the midday sun before the
advent of the rainy season, which destroys both shrub and seedpod.</p>
<p>Cocoa-nut trees (<i lang="la">Cocos nucifera</i>), called <i lang=
"tl">Nioc</i> by the Tagals, eminently contribute to the ornament,
comfort, and prosperity of the natives. Trunks, branches, leaves,
fruit, all are turned to account. Oil, wine and spirits are made from
its juices. The bark is employed for caulking and cables; the shell of
the cocoa is wrought and carved in many ways for spoons, cups and
domestic utensils; the burnt shell is employed for dyeing black. The
trunk often forms the frame, the leaves the cover, of the Indian
houses. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>The fibres of the leaves are manufactured into
cloths for garments; the fibres of the fruit into brushes. The pulp is
eaten or made into sweetmeats and the milk is esteemed for its
medicinal virtues. The root, when roasted, is used as a decoction for
the cure of dysentery.</p>
<p>A Spanish writer says that an Indian wants nothing but his
<i>Cocal</i> (cocoa-nut palm garden) for his comfortable support. The
tree will give him water, wine, oil, vinegar, food, cords, cups,
brushes, building materials, black paint, soap, roofing for his house,
strings for his rosaries, tow, red dye, medicine, plaister for wounds,
light, fire, and many other necessaries. It produces fruit after seven
years&rsquo; growth. The <i>nipa</i> palm is almost, though not quite
as useful. These spontaneous bounties of nature may not be the allies
or promoters of civilization, but they are the compensations which make
savage life tolerable and, if not of high enjoyment, not far from
happy.</p>
<p>A very small quantity of Pepper is now grown, though it was formerly
one of the most prized productions of the islands. It is said that the
Indians destroyed all their pepper plantations in consequence of frauds
practised on them by the Manila merchants.</p>
<p>Attempts to introduce some of the more costly spices, such as the
Cinnamon and Nutmeg, have not been attended with success.</p>
<p>Fruits are abundant. There are no less than fifty-seven varieties of
the banana. The fame of the Manila mango is universal in the East.
There are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>many sorts of oranges, pines (<i>ananas</i>) in
great quantities, guavas, rose-apples, and the mangosteen is found in
Mindanao. The chico is a favourite fruit in winter, somewhat resembling
the medlar, hut I must refer those who desire more extended information
to Father Blanco&rsquo;s <i>Flora</i>, imperfect though it be.</p>
<p>Among the riches of the Philippine Islands, the forest trees occupy
an important place. A collection of 350 specimens was sent to the Royal
Exhibition in London in the form of square-based prisms. In the year
1858 Colonel Valdes published a report on the character and resistance
of Philippine woods for buildings (<i lang="es">maderas de
construction</i>). The specimens on which the experiments were made
were cubes of one centimetre and prisms of one centimetre square by one
metre of breadth. The woods were allowed one year&rsquo;s drying. Five
experiments were made on each, and the average results adopted.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The buffalo is, perhaps, the most useful of Philippine
quadrupeds. Immense herds of wild buffaloes are found in the interior,
but the tamed animal is employed in the labours of the fields and the
transport of commodities, whether on its back or in waggons. His
enjoyment is to be merged in water or mud. Such is the attachment of
the mother to her young that she has been known to spring into the
river and furiously to pursue the crocodile that had robbed her of her
calf. Wild boars and deer abound.</p>
<p>A good deal of attention has been paid to improvement of the race of
native ponies, and their value has much increased with the increasing
demand. Till of late years the price was from forty to fifty dollars,
but the Captain-General told me that the four ponies which he was
accustomed to use in his carriage cost 500 dollars.</p>
<p>Though the accounts of the silent, concealed and rapid ravages of
the white ants would sometimes appear incredible, credulity respecting
them will outstrip <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273"
name="pb273">273</a>]</span>all bounds. We had a female servant at Hong
Kong who told us she had lent her savings in hard dollars to one of her
relations, and, on claiming repayment, was informed that the white ants
had eaten the dollars, nor did the woman&rsquo;s simplicity doubt the
story. In the Philippines at sunset during the rains their presence
becomes intolerable. One well-authenticated fact may serve as an
illustration of the destructive powers of these insects, to whom
beautiful gauze wings have been given, as to butterflies in the later
stage of their existence, which wings drop off as they find a
resting-place. In the town of Obando, province of Bulacan, on the 18th
of March, 1838, the various objects destined for the services of the
mass, such as robes, albs, amices, the garments of the priests, &amp;c,
were examined and placed in a trunk made of the wood called
<i>narra</i> (<i lang="la">Pterocarpus palidus</i>). On the 19th they
were used in the divine services, and in the evening were restored to
the box. On the 20th some dirt was observed near it, and on opening,
every fragment of the vestments and ornaments of every sort were found
to have been reduced to dust, except the gold and silver lace, which
were tarnished with a filthy deposit. On a thorough examination, not an
ant was found in any other part of the church, nor any vestige of the
presence of these voracious destroyers; but five days afterwards they
were discovered to have penetrated through a beam six inches thick.</p>
<p>Few of the larger wild animals are found in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>Philippines. The elephant must have been known
in former times, as the names <i>gadya</i> (elephant) and
<i>nangagadya</i> (elephant-hunting) are preserved in the Tagal<a id=
"xd21e11188" name="xd21e11188"></a> language. Oxen, swine, buffaloes,
deer, goats, sheep, a great variety of apes and monkeys, cats, flying
squirrels, dogs, rats, mungoes and other quadrupeds, are found in
various stages of domesticity and wildness.</p>
<p>The great insect pests of the Philippines are the white ants
(<i>termes</i>) and the mosquitos. Fleas, bugs and flies are less
numerous and tormenting than in many temperate regions.</p>
<p>Some of the bats measure from five to six feet from the tips of
their wings.</p>
<p>There are incredible stories about a small black bird of the swallow
race, which is said to make its nest in the tail of wild horses. De Mas
quotes what he calls undoubtedly trustworthy authorities<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11199src" href="#xd21e11199" name=
"xd21e11199src">1</a> for his arguments. There is an immense variety of
gallinaceous fowls, pigeons and birds, whose Indian names would to
European ornithologists bring little information; among which the
<i>balicyao</i> is celebrated for its song; the <i>mananayom</i>
(solitary), which always dies when captured; the <i>coling</i>, easily
taught to talk; numerous parrots; the <i>calao</i>, which has a large
transparent bill and crows like a cock; the <i>bocuit</i>, or bird of
seven colours, which has a singularly sweet note; the <i>valoor</i>, a
pigeon whose plumage is varied like <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>that of the
partridge; another called the <i>dundunay</i>, which is reported to be
one of the most beautiful of birds.</p>
<p>Snakes, lizards and other reptiles abound; spiders of enormous size,
tarantulas, &amp;c. The <i>guiko</i> is very disturbing, from its
noise. I was struck with the tenacity with which this creature held,
even in the agonies of death, to a piece of timber on which it was
placed; the soles of its feet seemed to have all the power of the
sucker with which boys amuse themselves, and the animal was detached
with great difficulty.</p>
<p>The fire-flies illuminate the forests at night. There are some trees
to which they attach themselves in preference to others. Few objects
are more beautiful than a bush or tree lighted by these bright and
glancing stars. The brilliant creatures seem to have a wonderful
sympathy with one another, sometimes by the production of a sudden
blaze of beautiful fire, of a light and delicate green, and sometimes
by its as sudden extinction.</p>
<p>Of aquatic creatures the tortoise is of considerable commercial
importance. The natives, who watch the time of their coming on shore,
conceal themselves, and, when a certain number are marching inland, run
between the tortoises and the waves, turn them one after another on
their backs, and return at their leisure to remove them. The large
bivalve called by the natives <i>taclovo</i>, and which is used much in
the churches as the receptacle for holy water, and is seen frequently
at the entrance of houses, is captured <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>by dropping a cord
upon the body of the animal when the shell is opened, the animal
immediately closes upon the cord, and is dragged to the surface with
the greatest ease. I am not aware of the existence of any conchological
work on the Philippines, though there is a great variety of land and
water shells. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=

<p class="first">The Mining Laws, <i lang="es">Reglamento de Minas</i>,
are of a liberal character and allow concessions to be made to any
person, Spaniard, Indian, mestizo, naturalized or established
foreigner, who shall discover and report the discovery of a mine, and
undertake to work it. Sundry officials and all ecclesiastics are
excluded from the privilege. The work must be entered upon in ninety
days, under certain conditions; four months of continued suspension, or
eight months of interrupted labour, within the year bring the loss of
the conceded privilege. There must not be less than eight labourers
employed. The mines are subjected to the inspection of the mining
department The mining regulations were published by the Captain-General
Claveria in January, 1846.</p>
<p>The gold of the Philippines is produced by washing and digging. In
several of the provinces it is found in the rivers, and natives are
engaged in washing their deposits. The most remarkable and profitable
of the gold mines worked by the Indians are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>those of Tulbin and Suyuc. They break the rock
with hammers, and crush it between two small millstones, dissolving the
fragments in water, by which the gold is separated. They melt it in
small shells, and it produces generally from eight to ten dollars an
ounce, but its fineness seldom exceeds sixteen carats. It is found in
quartz, but the nuggets are seldom of any considerable size. The
inhabitants of Caraga cut in the top of a mountain a basin of
considerable size, and conduct water to it through canals made of the
wild palm; they dig up the soil while the basin is filling, which is
opened suddenly, and exhibits for working any existing stratification
of gold; these operations are continued till the pits get filled with
inroads of earth, when they are abandoned; generally, when a depth has
been reached which produces the most advantageous returns, the rush of
waters conveys away much of the metal which would otherwise be
deposited and collected. Gold is also found in the alluvial deposits
which are ground between stones, thrown into water, and the metal sinks
to the bottom. The rivers of Caraballo, Camarines, and Misamis, and the
mountains of Caraga and Zebu, are the most productive. Many Indian
families support themselves by washing the river sands, and in the
times of heavy rains gold is found in the streets of some of the
pueblos when the floods have passed. There can be no doubt of the
existence of much gold in the islands, but principally in the parts
inhabited by the independent tribes.</p>
<p>The Sociedad Exploradora is engaged in working <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>gold-mines and washing auriferous sands in the
province of New Ecija.</p>
<p>Gold dust is the instrument of exchange in the interior of Mindanao,
and is carried about in bags for the ordinary purposes of life. The
possession of California by the Spaniards for so many generations
without the development of its riches may explain their inertness and
indifference in the Philippines, notwithstanding the repeated averments
of Spanish writers that the archipelago abounds in gold.</p>
<p>Iron also abounds, especially in the province of Bulacan; but it may
be doubted whether it can be produced as cheaply as it may be imported,
especially while roads are in so backward a state, and carriage charges
so heavy. Many iron-works have been entered on and abandoned.</p>
<p>A coal-mine is being explored at Guila Guila, in the island of Zebu,
on the river Mananga, at a distance of about six miles from the town of
San Nicolas, which has nearly 20,000 inhabitants and is by far the
largest town in the island. There are reported to be strata of coal
from one to four feet in thickness. The proprietor informs me that he
expects in the course of another year to be able to deliver coals on
the coast at a moderate rate in Tangui, which is close to the town of
Falisay.</p>
<p>Of the various objects of speculation, mining is probably the most
attractive to the adventurer, from the high premiums which it sometimes
brings to the successful. When the risk is divided among many
shareholders, it partakes of the character of a lottery, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>in
which the chances are proportioned to the stakes; but where, as in most
of the mining speculations of the Philippines, the enterprises are
conducted by individuals, without adequate means to overcome the
preliminary difficulties and to support the needful outlay,
disappointment, loss, ruin and the abandonment of probably valuable and
promising undertakings are but of too frequent occurrence. I have
before me some details of the attempts made to work the copper ores of
Mancayan, in the district of Cagan (now called Lepanto), in South
Ilocos (Luzon). They have been worked in the rudest way by the Igorrote
Indians from time immemorial, and the favourable report of the richness
of the ores which were sent to Europe led to renewed but inadequate
attempts for their exploitation. A good deal of money has, I
understand, been lost, without providing the necessary machinery for
extracting the metal, or roads for its conveyance. A sample taken from
a stratum ten feet in height and seven in breadth, on the side of a pit
four yards deep, gave, as the results of an analysis, 44 per cent. of
copper, 29 of sulphur, 18 of arsenic, and 9 of iron. The ruggedness of
the rocks, the thickness of the forest jungle, the indolence of the
natives, and, probably more than these, the absence of an intelligent
direction and sufficient pecuniary resources, have produced much
discouragement. Don Antonio Hernandez says there are 280 Indian
(Igorrote) families occupied in Mancayan in copper digging and melting;
that they only produce annually about 200 picos <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>(of
137&frac12; lbs. each), which they sell at from eight to nine dollars
per pico on the spot; to the neighbouring Christian Indians at ten to
twelve, who resell them on the coast at from thirteen to sixteen
dollars.</p>
<p>The Indians in Ilocos and Pangasinan manufacture their own domestic
utensils from the copper extracted by themselves.</p>
<p>Finely variegated marbles exist in the province of Bataan, and some
have been used for ornamenting the churches; but their existence has
excited little attention, and no sale was found for some large blocks
quarried by a patriotic adventurer.</p>
<p>I have before mentioned that there are many mineral waters in the
island&mdash;sulphurous and ferruginous&mdash;at Antipolo. In the
Laguna there is a virgin patroness, whose festival lasts eighteen days,
and immense crowds of all races come to drink the waters, and join the
processions in her honour. The inhabitants of Manila attribute great
virtues to the waters of Pagsanghan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">MANUFACTURES.</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The art of weaving, or that of crossing threads so as
to produce a wearable tissue, is one of the evidences of a transition
from savage towards civilized life. In cold countries the painting the
body, or covering it with furs and skins, or bark of trees, is the
resource of a wild people; but the necessity for dress of any sort is
so little felt in tropical regions that the missionaries claim the
credit of introducing the loom, and of instructing the natives in all
the matters most conducive to their comforts. For their houses they
taught them to make lime and brick and tiles&mdash;staircases, windows
and chimneys&mdash;and better to protect themselves against rain and
storms; chairs, tables and domestic utensils followed; carriages for
conveyance of commodities; but, above all, the friars boast of the
application, and devotion, and success of the Indians in decorating the
Christian churches, building and ornamenting altars, sculpturing
virgins and saints, and generally contributing to the splendours of
ecclesiastical ceremonials.</p>
<p>The science of ship-building made great advances. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>To
the canoes (<i>barotos</i> is the Indian name) scooped out of a single
trunk, and used only for river navigation, succeeded well-built vessels
of several hundred tons, by which a commerce along the coast and among
the islands was established. At first the planks were the whole length
of the vessel, but European improvements have gradually been adopted,
and the ships now built in the Philippines are not distinguishable from
those of the mother country. We found many on the stocks on the banks
of the river Agno, and the Indian constructors were desirous of looking
into all the details of H. M.&rsquo;s ship <i>Magicienne</i>, in which
the captain and officers most courteously aided them, in order to avail
themselves of any improvements which our vessel exhibited. The cost of
construction was reported to be about 15<i>l.</i> sterling per ton. The
<i>Bella Bascongada</i>, a vessel of 760 tons, built in Pangasinan,
cost 54,000 dollars, or about 11,000<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>
<p>Little has been done for the introduction of improved machinery for
the manufacture of tissues, which are made of silk, cotton,
abac&aacute;, and, above all, the exquisitely fine fabrics produced
from the fibre of the pine-apple leaf, called <i>pi&ntilde;as</i>.
These are worked on the simplest looms, made of bamboos, and of a
thread so fine that it is necessary to protect it, by the use of a fine
gauze, from even the agitation of the wind. The Bisayan provinces, and
especially the neighbourhood of Iloilo, are most distinguished for the
manufacture of this beautiful tissue, which is sent to the capital for
embroidery, and prices which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>seem fabulous are paid for the
more elaborate specimens&mdash;one or two ounces of gold being
frequently given for a small handkerchief. In Zebu handsome cotton rugs
are made, and in Panay a variety of stuffs of sundry materials.</p>
<p>The Indians have the art of softening and manufacturing horn. In
metals they make chains of silver and gold of great fineness, for which
formerly there was a great demand in Mexico, but I believe European
jewellery has supplanted the Indian craftsman.</p>
<p>Mats are a remarkable production of the islands. Many of them are
very beautiful, of various colours, and are ornamented with gold and
silver patterns. As mattresses are never used for beds, everybody
sleeps on a mat, which in some cases, but not generally, is provided
with a sheet and a long soft pillow, which is placed between the legs
and deemed a needful appliance for comfortable repose.</p>
<p>Fibre-wrought hats and cigar-cases of various colours, the white,
however, being the most costly and beautiful, compete with similar
productions of the natives of Panama.</p>
<p>The tools and instruments employed by the Indians in manufacture are
all of the simplest and rudest character.</p>
<p>The alcoholic beverage called <i lang="es">vino de nipa</i> is
largely produced in the Philippines. It was made a monopoly as early as
1712 in the provinces near the capital, and then produced 10,000
dollars of annual revenue; the farm was abolished in 1780, and in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>1814 the collection was transferred to the
general administration. The juice is obtained by cutting a hole in a
pulpy part of the palm, introducing a bamboo cane, and binding the tree
over the receiving vessel. The sale of the nipa wine is a monopoly in
the hands of the Government. The monopoly is much and reasonably
complained of by the Indians. Excise duties leading to domiciliary
visits, and interfering with the daily concerns of life, have been
always and in all countries deemed one of the most vexatious and
disagreeable forms of taxation. Man, whatever be his colour, is
everywhere man, and everywhere exhibits, though in different forms, the
same general dislikes and sympathies. The heavy hand of extortion and
oppression does not crush the Filipinos, but a redistribution of the
forms of taxation would be beneficial to the fiscal interest and
satisfactory to the people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href=

<p>I have selected most of these proverbs, aphorisms and moral and
religious maxims from Fr. de los Santos&rsquo; folio volume, and they
would have some interest if they represented the thoughts and feelings
of a civilized nation. That interest will hardly be less when the
social code of semi-barbarians is studied in these short sentences. The
influence and teachings of the priests will be found in many; others
will be deemed characteristic of local usages, and some will find a
recommendation in their grotesqueness and originality. I have thought
these examples of the language might not be without their value to
philologists. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=

<p class="first">To foreign nations&mdash;to our own
especially&mdash;the particular interest felt in the state of the
Philippines is naturally more of a commercial than of a political
character. They <i>must</i> grow in trading importance; already enough
has been done to make a retrograde or even a stationary policy
untenable. Every step taken towards emancipation from the ancient
fetters which ignorance and monopoly laid upon their progress has been
so successful and so productive as to promise and almost to ensure
continuance in a course now proved to be alike beneficial to the public
treasury and to the common weal. The statistics which I have been able
to collect are often unsatisfactory and inaccurate, but, upon the
whole, may be deemed approximative to the truth, and certainly not
without value as means of comparison between the results of that
narrow-minded exclusive system which so long directed the councils of
Spain and the administration of <i lang="es">las Indias</i>, and the
wiser and more liberal views which make their way through the dense
darkness of the past. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>The caprices and mischiefs of a privileged and protected trade and
the curses which monopolies bring with them to the general interests,
may, indeed, be well studied in the ancient legislation of Spain as
regards her colonies. One vessel only was formerly allowed to proceed
from the Philippines to Mexico; she was to be commanded by officers of
the royal navy, equipped as a ship of war, and was subject to a variety
of absurd restrictions and regulations: the adventurers were to pay
20,000 dollars for their privilege; and no one was allowed to adventure
unless he were a <i lang="es">vocal de consulado</i>, which required a
residence of several years in the islands, and the possession of
property to the extent of 8,000 dollars. The privilege often passed
clandestinely, by purchase, into the hands of friars, officials, women
and other speculators&mdash;and it may well be supposed at what prices
the goods had to be invoiced. Such being the licensed pillage in Asia,
on arriving at Acapulco, in America, to which place the cargo was
necessarily consigned, 33&#8531; per cent. was imposed upon the
valuation of the Manila invoices. And on the return of the ship similar
or even more absurd conditions were exacted: she was only allowed to
bring back double the value of the cargo she conveyed; but, as the
profits were often enormous, every species of fraud was practised to
give fictitious values to the articles imported&mdash;in fact, from the
beginning to the end of the undertaking there seems to have been a
rivalry in roguery among all parties concerned.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Company of the Philippines, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>in
1785, gave to monopoly another shape, but led to some development of
colonial industry.</p>
<p>It is scarcely needful to follow the history of the commerce of the
Philippines through the many changes which have produced its present
comparative prosperity&mdash;a prosperity to be measured by the amount
of emancipation which has been introduced. Had the Spanish authorities
the courage to utter the magic words &ldquo;Laissez faire, laissez
passer!&rdquo; what a cornucopia of blessings would be poured upon the
archipelago!</p>
<p>But it could hardly be expected from a government constituted like
the government of Spain, that, either of its own spontaneous movement,
or by licence delegated to the Captain-General, so grand a work would
be accomplished as the establishment of free production, free commerce,
free settlement, and free education in the Philippines; and yet a step
so bold and noble would, as I fully believe, in a few years be followed
by progress and prosperity far beyond any calculations that have been
ventured on. The little that has been hazarded for the liberty of
trade, though hurriedly and imperfectly done, cannot but encourage
future efforts; and in the meantime many beneficial reforms have been
pressed upon the attention of the government with such conclusive
statistics and irresistible logic, that, if it depended on these alone,
the Philippines might hope to enter upon the early enjoyment of their
heritage of future advancement. The reform of the tariffs&mdash;the
removal of petty vexatious fiscal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295"
href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>interferences&mdash;improvements in the
navigation of the rivers&mdash;the cleansing the
harbours&mdash;lighthouse, buoys and other appliances for the security
of shipping&mdash;are among the more obvious and immediate claims of
commerce. In Manila the absence of docks for repairing and harbouring
vessels is much felt; the custom-house is on the wrong side of the
river&mdash;though it were better it should exist on neither side;
there are no means of regular postal communication with the islands
from the Peninsula; tug-steamers, life-boats, quays and piers,
seamen&rsquo;s houses, marine hospitals, are wanting, but their
introduction has been so strongly advocated that its advent may be
hoped for. In truth, it is pleasant to find in a country so remote and
so long under the most discouraging and retarding influences, that
inquiry, which is the pioneer and the handmaid of all improvement, is
already busily at work and will not be at work in vain.</p>
<p>A communication was made to the Chamber of Commerce by the
Governor-General in 1858, requesting that the merchants would point out
to him the best possible means for developing the riches of the
Philippine Islands by extending their foreign trade. The British
merchants, after expressing a general wish that the islands should
enjoy the benefits of that system of free trade and liberal commercial
policy whose &ldquo;great results&rdquo; are manifest to all, point out
the special grievances which demand immediate reform.</p>
<p>1. The present system of requiring <i>permits</i> for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>every cargo boat employed, leads to many
needless charges, vexations and delays.</p>
<p>2. Reform of the tariffs which press very heavily on certain
articles, for the protection of some small manufacturing interest in
the island. This is specially the case with cotton goods intended for
common use; those of the colours given by dyes produced in the island
are selected for the heaviest impost, to give encouragement to native
dyers. Many articles are estimated much beyond their real value, so
that the percentage duty becomes excessive. Lawns, for instance, are
tariffed at double their market price. Iron chains worth five dollars
per cwt. are tariffed at twelve dollars. A small quantity of white,
black, blue, purple and rose-coloured cotton twist being produced,
there is a duty of from 40 to 50 per cent., while red, yellow, green,
&amp;c., which the natives cannot dye, are admitted duty free. These
are striking exemplifications of the workings of a protective
system.</p>
<p>Other blue goods are prohibited because the islands produce indigo;
and for the protection of the native shoemakers (who, by the way, are
almost invariably Chinese and mere birds of passage in the country),
foreign boots and shoes pay from 40 to 50 per cent., to the great
detriment of the public health, for the country-tanned leather will not
keep out the rain and the mud, while the protective duty encourages the
Chinese settler to become a manufacturer, who is less wanted than the
agricultural labourer. In the same spirit the tailors are protected,
<i>i.e.</i> allowed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href=
"#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>overcharge the consumer to the
extent of 40 to 50 per cent., the duty on imported clothes, which goes
principally to the Chinese. Foreign fruits, preserves and liquors have
to bear similar burdens, for cannot the Philippines give confectionary
and sweets enough of their own? So runs the round of folly and
miscalculation. One hundred dozen of Spanish beer entered the
Philippines in 1857, and to protect and encourage so important an
interest an excessive impost was levied on 350 pipes and nearly 100,000
bottles of beer <i>not</i> Spanish.</p>
<p>3. Then, again, the heavy differential duties in favour of Spanish
ships are a well-grounded subject of discontent and highly prejudicial
to the general interest. The levying tonnage duties upon ships entering
and departing without cargoes is a grievance of which there are just
complaints. The adjacency of so many free ports&mdash;Hong Kong, Macao
and Singapore&mdash;and the more liberal system of the Australian and
Polynesian regions, place the Philippine trade in a disadvantageous
position. Among the documents which I collected is one from a native
merchant, in which he says:&mdash;&ldquo;The demonstrations of
political economists, and the practical results of free-trade
legislation, establish the fact that public credit and public
prosperity are alike benefited by the emancipation of commerce, and
narrow is the view which, looking only to the temporary defalcation of
revenue from the diminution of imports, forgets the enormous increase
of all the sources of revenue from lowering prices and extending
demand.&rdquo; In this way the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298"
href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>great truths which have been
silently and successfully revolutionizing our commercial legislation
are spread on all the wings of all the winds, and will finally encircle
the world in the great bonds of brotherhood, with peace and prosperity
for attendants.</p>
<p>By a decree of the 18th June, 1857, the restrictions on the trade in
rice and paddy were removed, and foreign grain was allowed to enter
duty free, not, only into the ports opened to foreign trade, but into
divers subordinate ports. Though the permission was then temporary, it
has now become permanent, and I found that the emancipation of these
important articles from all custom-house interference had been attended
with the best results, by regulating and assimilating prices, without
any detriment to native production. The more general the principles of
free trade the more security will there be against dearth and famine on
the one side, and superfluity and glut on the other.</p>
<p>Rice is sold by the cavan. Its price is ordinarily double that of
paddy. The average fluctuations are from one to two dollars.</p>
<p>In 1810 the import trade of the Philippines amounted to only
5,329,000 dollars, of which more than half consisted of precious
metals, sent from the Spanish colonies of America. From Europe and the
United States the trade was only 175,000 dollars. The exports were
4,795,000 dollars, of which one-and-a-half million consisted of silver
to China, and the whole amount of exports to Europe and the United
States was 250,000 dollars. The great start <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>took
place in 1834, when the monopoly of the Philippine Company terminated,
and commerce may be regarded as progressive from that time. Of the
trade with the surrounding islands, that with Jolo, conducted
principally by Chinese, is important. One of the leading articles of
export is the edible bird&rsquo;s-nests, of whose collection a Spanish
writer gives the following account:&mdash;&ldquo;The nests are
collected twice a year; those most valued from deep and humid caverns.
Early training is needful to scale the localities where the nests are
found, and the task is always dangerous. To reach the caves it is
necessary to descend perpendicularly many hundred feet, supported by a
rope made of bamboo or junk, suspended over the sea waves as they dash
against the rocks.&rdquo; There is also from Jolo a considerable
exportation of tortoise-shell. <i>Trepang</i> (sea-slug,
<i>Holothuria</i>) and shark-fins are sent to the Chinese markets; also
mother-of-pearl, wax and gold dust. The voyage from Manila to Jolo and
return generally occupies seven to eight months. A trade in most
respects resembling that of Jolo is carried on between Manila and the
Moluccas. Spices are, however, added to the imports. There is a large
trade between Singapore and Manila, and with Amoy, in China, the
transactions are very important. Vessels are generally loading from and
to that port. Rice, paddy, cocoa-nut oil, sugar, fine woods, table
delicacies and a variety of minor articles, are exported; silks,
nankins, tea, vermilion, umbrellas, earthenware and a thousand smaller
matters, make up the returns. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300"
href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span></p>
<p>Internal trade suffers much from the many impediments to
communication and the various shiftings to which merchandise is
exposed. It is said that in the transit from the north of Luzon to the
capital there are as many as a hundred floating rafts upon which the
goods must be carried across the different streams; at each
considerable delay is experienced, as the raft (<i>balsa</i>) is seldom
found when and where it is wanted. And during half the year inland
conveyance is the only means of transport, as the monsoons make the sea
voyage impossible for coasting vessels. Indeed, in the remoter islands
months frequently pass without arrivals from the capital. Some of the
fairs in the interior are largely attended by the Mahomedan and heathen
natives, who will not visit the ports or larger towns. That of Yligan
(Misamis, in Mindanao) is much visited by Moros, who bring thither for
sale paddy, cocoa, coffee, gold dust, cotton fabrics, krises and
weapons of war, with many other native articles, which they exchange
mostly for European and Chinese wares. Panaguis, in Luzon, is another
market much frequented by the Igorrote Indians. Many of the ancient
river communications have been stopped by inundations, which have given
a new direction to the stream, and by the invasion of snags, trees and
rocks from the upper regions. There is a great deal of ambulatory petty
trade in the interior; the Chinese especially are active pedlars and
factors, and make their way to buy and to sell wherever there is a
profit to be gained. They are to a great extent the pioneers of
commerce, and in this way valuable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301"
href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>auxiliaries and co-operators
by opening new fields to be hereafter more extensively explored.</p>
<p>There are in Manila seven English, three American, two French, two
Swiss and one German, commercial establishments. In the new ports there
is no European house of business except at Iloilo, where there is an
English firm, of which the British vice-consul is the directing
partner.</p>
<p>Among the curiosities of commercial legislation is a decree of the
governor of the Philippines, dated only a few years ago, by which it
was ordered that no vessel should be allowed to introduce a cargo from
China or the East Indies unless an engagement was entered into by the
captain to bring to Manila <i>five hundred</i> living shrikes
(<i>mimas?</i>), as the bird was reported to be most useful in
destroying the insects which were at that time seriously damaging the
harvests. I believe not a single bird was ever brought. It would have
been about as easy and as reasonable to require them to import some
slices of the moon, for the catching, and the caging, and the keeping,
are scarcely within mortal capabilities, and 500 birds were the
required <i>minimum</i> by every ship; nor was it the least remarkable
part of the decree or requirement that they were all to be delivered
gratis.</p>
<p>For the protection of the revenue there is an armed body called the
<i lang="es">Carabineros de Real Hacienda</i>. It is composed of
natives under European officers, and is charged with both land and sea
service. They wear a military uniform and a broad hat resembling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>a large punch-bowl, which is, however, an
admirable protection from the sun&rsquo;s rays.</p>
<p>Great Britain has a salaried consul and vice-consul in Manila and
vice-consuls in Iloilo and Sual. France has also a salaried consul in
the capital. The United States, Portugal, Belgium, Sweden and Chili,
are represented by members of commercial establishments, who exercise
consular authority in Manila. The American consul is Mr. Charles
Griswold, and few are the visitors to these islands who have not
enjoyed his hospitality and benefited by his experience.</p>
<p>The post-office establishments are imperfect and unsatisfactory and
the charges for the conveyance of letters heavy. There is a weekly
postal communication from the capital with the provinces in the island
of Luzon, and southwards as far as Samar and Leyte, but all the other
eastern and southern islands are left to the chances which the coasting
trade offers and are frequently many months without receiving any news
from the capital or the mother country. A regular service, providing
for the wants of these important districts, Panay especially, with its
population exceeding half a million, is greatly to be desired.</p>
<p>There is now a fortnightly service carried on by the steamers of the
Peninsular and Oriental Company between Manila and Hong Kong, generally
reaching forty-eight hours before the departure, and quitting
forty-eight hours after the arrival, of the steamers from Europe. It is
conducted with great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303"
name="pb303">303</a>]</span>regularity and the letters from Spain
arrive in about fifty days; but many days would be saved were there a
branch steamer from Malta to Alicant. For this service an annual sum
(recoverable monthly) of 120,000 dollars is paid by the Manila
government to the company. The steamers are freed from all port charges
except pilotage.</p>
<p>The government has published proposals for the establishment of a
steam-packet company for the service of the islands, offering 45,000
dollars annually as a State contribution, but I believe there is no
immediate prospect of the adoption of the scheme.</p>
<p>The Banco Espa&ntilde;ol de Isabel II. is a joint-stock company,
whose capital is 400,000 dollars, in 1,000 shares of 400 dollars each.
It was established in the year 1855, and has generally paid to the
shareholders dividends at the rate of six to eight per cent. per annum.
It issues promissory notes, discounts local bills of exchange and lends
money on mortgage. The general rate of interest in the Philippines
fluctuates from six to nine per cent. The yearly operations of the bank
exceed 2,000,000 of dollars. The value of about half-a-million of bills
of exchange is usually under discount. Its ordinary circulation does
not exceed 200,000 dollars in promissory notes and it has deposits and
balances to the value of about 1,750,000 dollars. The bank has afforded
considerable facilities to commerce, and has answered one of its
principal objects, that of bringing into circulation some of the
hoarded money <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>of the natives. Most of the foreign houses are
shareholders.</p>
<p>The decimal system of accounts and currency was introduced into the
Philippines by a royal decree, and an end put to all the complications
of maravedis, quartos, and reales de ocho, by the simple adoption of
the dollar, divided into one hundred cents. It would be, indeed, a
wretched compliment to the population of England (let me say it in
passing) if, as certain opponents of improvement have averred, they
would never be brought to appreciate or comprehend a change to decimal
denominations which the &ldquo;untutored mind&rdquo; of the &ldquo;wild
Indian&rdquo; has already begun to adopt, using his digits as the
instruments of the new philosophy, and aided now and then probably by
the simple abacus of the Chinese shopkeeper, with whom he has much to
do.</p>

<p>In the year 1855, Don Sinibaldo de Mas, having been charged with an
official mission of inquiry into the state of these islands, published
an article on the revenues of the Philippines, addressed to the finance
minister of Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12893src" href=
"#xd21e12893" name="xd21e12893src">1</a></p>
<p>He begins his report by contrasting the population and commerce of
Cuba with that of the Philippines; stating that Cuba, with less than a
million of inhabitants, has a trade of 27,500,000 dollars, while the
Philippines, which he says contained, in 1850, 4,000,000 of people in a
state of subjection and 1,000,000 unsubdued, had a trade of less than
5,000,000 of dollars. He calculates the coloured population of Cuba at
500,000; the white population of the Philippines at from 7,000 to 8,000
persons. He deduces that, if the produce of the Philippines were
proportioned to that of Cuba, it would be of the value of 250,000,000
dollars, and that the revenue should be 48,000,000 dollars, instead of
about 9,500,000 dollars.</p>
<p>He avers that the soil is equal in its productive powers to any in
the world; that the quality of the produce&mdash;sugar, coffee,
tobacco, indigo, cocoa and cotton&mdash;is most excellent; that it
possesses almost a monopoly of abac&aacute; (Manila hemp); and he goes
on to consider the means of turning these natural advantages to the
best account.</p>
<p>He altogether repudiates any extension of the existing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>system, or augmentation of taxation in its
present forms; and states, what is most true, that to the development
of agriculture, industry and commerce the Philippines must look for
increased prosperity.</p>
<p>His three proposals are:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Opening new ports to foreign trade.</p>
<p>2. Emancipating the production, manufacture and sale of tobacco.</p>
<p>3. Increasing the population of the islands.</p>
<p>By a royal decree, dated 31st March, 1855, three additional ports
were opened to foreign trade&mdash;Zamboanga (Mindanao), Iloilo
(Panay), and Sual (Luzon). The results have not responded to
anticipations. One reason is obvious&mdash;custom-house officers,
custom-house restrictions, custom-house vexations accompanied the
seemingly liberal legislation. These are sufficient to check, if not to
crush, the growth of intercourse. I doubt if in either of the new ports
the custom-house receipts cover the costs of collection. The experiment
should have been a free-trade experiment, but the jealousies and fears
of the capital were probably influential. It ought not to have been
forgotten that the new ports, charged with all the burdens which
pressed upon Manila, offered none of its facilities, the creation of
many generations&mdash;wharves and warehouses, accomplished merchants,
capital, foreign settlers, assured consumption of imports and supply of
exports; these counterbalanced the cost of conveyance of goods to or
from the capital, while, on the other hand, the introduction of a
custom-house has prejudiced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href=
"#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>the trade which previously
existed&mdash;as, for example, the call of whalers at Zamboanga,
unwilling to submit to the fiscal exactions now introduced. But if
every port in the Philippines were made free from custom-houses a great
impulse would be given to industry, commerce and shipping; the loss to
the treasury would be inconsiderable, for the net proceeds of the
customs duties is very insignificant, while other sources of revenue
would be undoubtedly increased by the impulse given to the general
prosperity. De Mas states that the extension of the trade of Cuba from
the Havana to other ports led to an augmentation in its value from
2,000,000 to 30,000,000 dollars.</p>
<p>Two plans are suggested by Se&ntilde;or De Mas for the emancipation
of the tobacco cultivation and manufacture from the existing State
monopoly. One, the levying a heavy land tax on all lands devoted to the
produce; the other, the imposition of a duty on exportation. He
estimates that a <i>baleta</i> of land (1,000 brazas square) gives
1,500 plants, and 4 to 5 cwt. of tobacco, saleable at 4 to 5 dollars
per quintal. The cost of manufacturing 14,000 cigars, which represent 1
cwt., 5&frac14; dollars, and boxes for packing, 3&frac12; dollars. He
says the value of the cigars is 6&frac12; dollars per box (it is now
considerably more), in which case the profit would be 77&frac14;
dollars, and proposes a duty of 70 dollars per cwt., which is more than
five times the cost of the article. He gives satisfactory reasons for
the conclusion that cigars would be made much more economically by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>the peasantry than by the government, shows that
the cost of the machinery of administration might be greatly
diminished, asserts that the Indians employed at home would be
satisfied with lower gains than the wages paid by the government, and
supposes that the unoccupied houses of the natives would be dedicated
to the making of cigars as a pleasant and profitable domestic
employment. It may be doubted whether he estimates at its full value
the resistance which the indolent habits of the Indian oppose to
voluntary or spontaneous labour; but the conclusion I have reached by
not exactly the same train of reasoning is the same as that arrived at
by my friend whom I have been quoting, namely, that the government
monopoly is less productive than free cultivation, manufacture and sale
might become; that a reduction of prices would extend demand, leave
larger benefits to the treasury and confer many advantages upon the
people; and that the arguments (mostly of those interested in the
monopoly) in favour of the existing system are not grounded on sound
reasoning, nor supported by statistical facts.</p>
<p>The tobacco monopoly (<i lang="es">estanco</i>) was established in
1780 by Governor-General Basco; it was strongly opposed by the friars,
and menaces of severe punishments were held over those who sought to
escape the obligations imposed. But to the present hour there are said
to be large plantations of tobacco which escape the vigilance of
government, and cigars are purchaseable in many of the islands at
one-fourth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>of the government price. The personal
establishment for the protection of the tobacco monopoly consists of
nearly a thousand officials and more than thirty revenue boats. It is,
notwithstanding, cultivated largely in provinces where the cultivation
is prohibited by law; and I find in a report from the Alcalde of
Misamis (Mindanao) the following phrase: &ldquo;The idea of interfering
with the growth of tobacco for the benefit of the treasury must be
abandoned, as the territory where it is produced is not subject to
Spanish authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attempts were made a few years ago to encourage the planting of
tobacco in the province of Iloilo, by a company which made advances to
the Indians; but the enterprise, discouraged by the government, failed,
and I found, when I visited the locality, the warehouses abandoned and
the company dissolved. There have been many expeditions for the
destruction and confiscation of illicit tobacco; and on more than one
occasion insurrections, tumults, serious loss of life and very doubtful
results have followed these interferences. The statistical returns show
that the consumption of the State tobacco varies considerably in the
different provinces, being influenced by the greater or less difficulty
of obtaining the contraband article.</p>
<p>There have been divers projects for augmenting the population of the
Philippines&mdash;from China, from Switzerland, from Borneo and even
from British India. The friars have never looked with complacency on
any of these schemes. They all present <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>elements which would
not easily he subjected to ecclesiastical influence. The Chinese would
not be willing cultivators of the soil if any other pursuit should
promise greater profits, and it is quite certain that the indolent
Indian will nowhere be able to compete with the industrious,
persevering and economical Chinese. Many suggestions have been made for
the introduction of Chinese women, with a view of attaching Chinese
families to the soil; but hitherto nothing has sufficed to conquer the
abhorrence with which a Chinese female contemplates the abandonment of
her country, nor the general resistance to such abandonment on the part
of the Chinese clans. Chinese female children have been frequently
kidnapped for conveyance to the Philippines, and some horrible
circumstances have come to the knowledge of British authorities in
China, followed by the exposure and punishment of British subjects
concerned in these cruel and barbarous deeds. An establishment of a
sisterhood in China, called that of the <i lang="es">Sainte
Enfance</i>, has been looked to as a means of christianizing female
children, and conveying them to the Philippines; they have collected or
purchased many orphans, but small success has attended these
well-meant, but not well-directed labours. In 1855, it was stated in an
official document (De Mas, p. 26) that in 1858, an annual entry of
2,500 children might be expected. The calculation has been a total
mistake; the establishments in China are in a state of embarrassment
and difficulty, and I am not aware that a single Chinese female has
been supplied for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href=
"#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>suggested purpose. Any number of
orphans or abandoned children might be bought in the great cities of
China, especially from the orphan asylums; but an increased demand
would only encourage their abandonment by their mothers. These
foundling hospitals are of very doubtful utility, and produce,
probably, more misery than they cure.</p>
<p>The greatest impediment to the progress of the Philippines, and the
development of their immense resources, is attributable to the
miserable traditional policy of the mother country, whose jealousies
tie the hands of the governors they appoint to rule; so that the
knowledge and experience which are acquired in the locality are wholly
subjected to the ignorance and shortsightedness of the distant, but
supreme authority. Would the Spaniard but recognize the wisdom of one
of their many instructive proverbs&mdash;<i lang="es">Mas sabe el loco
en su casa que cuerdo en la agena</i> (the fool knows more about his
own home than the wise man of the home of another)&mdash;more
confidence might be reposed in those who are thoroughly cognizant of
local circumstances and local wants. As it is, everything has to be
referred to Madrid. A long delay is inevitable&mdash;an erroneous
decision probable; circumstances are constantly changing, and what
would have been judicious to-day may be wholly unadvisable to-morrow.
Then there is the greatest unwillingness to surrender even the shadow
of authority, or any of those sources of patronage which a government
so enervate and corrupt as that of Spain clings to as its props and
protection. Again, the uncertainty of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>tenure of office,
which attaches to all the superior offices held under the Spanish
Government, is alike calculated to demoralize and discourage. Before a
governor has surveyed his territory and marked out to himself a course
of action, he may be superseded under one of those multitudinous
changes which grow out of the caprices of the court or the clamour of
the people. It was a melancholy employment of mine to look round the
collection of the various portraits of the captains-general which
adorned my apartment, bearing the dates of their appointment and their
supersession. Some of them only occupied their office for a few months,
and were as carelessly and recklessly dismissed as a worthless weed is
flung away. And there seemed no expectation of any change in this
respect, for there were many blank frames made to receive the <i lang=
"es">vera effigies</i> of future excellencies. Our colonial system is
wiser, as we appoint governors for six years, and, except under special
circumstances, they are not dispossessed of their government. Whether
there may be any moral deterioration connected with the possession of
power, sufficient to counterbalance all the benefits which are
furnished by long experience and local knowledge, may be a question for
philosophy and statesmanship.</p>
<p>But other causes of backwardness are traceable to those very
elements of wealth and prosperity, to which these islands must look for
their future progress. A soil so feracious, a sun so bright, rains so
bountiful, require so little co-operation from the aid of man that he
becomes careless, indolent, unconcerned <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>for the morrow. He
has but to stretch out his hand, and food drops into it. The fibre of
the aloe, which the female weaves with the simplest of looms, gives her
garments; the uprights and the floors and the substantial parts of his
dwelling are made of the bamboo, which he finds in superfluous
abundance; while the nipa palm provides roofs and sides to his hut.
Wants he has few and he cares little for luxuries. His enjoyments are
in religious processions, in music and dancing, in his <i>gallo</i>
above all. He may take possession without rent of any quantity of land
which he is willing to cultivate. There is a tendency, no doubt, to
improvement. Cultivation extends and good examples are not without
effect.</p>
<p>In times of tranquillity Spain has nothing to fear for her
Philippine colonies. So long as they are unmolested by foreign invaders
and the government is carried on with mildness and prudence, there is
little to be apprehended from any internal agitation; but I doubt the
efficiency of any means of defence at the disposal of the authorities,
should a day of trouble come. The Indian regular forces might for some
time be depended on; but whether this could be anticipated of the
<i>militia</i> or any of the urban auxiliaries is uncertain. The number
of Spaniards is small&mdash;in most of the islands quite insignificant;
indolence and indifference characterize the indigenous races; and if,
on the one hand, they took no part in favour of intrusive strangers, on
the other, they could not be looked to for any patriotic or energetic
exertions on behalf of their Spanish rulers. They have, indeed, no
traditions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>of former independence&mdash;no descendants of
famous ancient chiefs or princes, to whom they look with affection,
hope or reverence. There are no fragments left of hierarchies
overthrown. No Montezumas, no Colocolos, are named in their songs, or
perpetuated in their memories. There are no ruins of great cities or
temples; in a word, no records of the remote past. There is a certain
amount of dissatisfaction among the Indians, but it is more strongly
felt against the native gobernadorcillos&mdash;the heads of
barangay&mdash;the privileged members of the local
principalia&mdash;when exercising their &ldquo;petty tyrannies,&rdquo;
than against the higher authorities, who are beyond the hearing of
their complaints. &ldquo;The governor-general is in Manila (far away);
the king is in Spain (farther still); and God is in heaven (farthest of
all).&rdquo; It is a natural complaint that the tribute or capitation
tax presses equally on all classes of Indians, rich or poor. The heads
of barangay, who are charged with its collection, not unfrequently
dissipate the money in gambling. One abuse has, however, been
reformed&mdash;the tribute in many provinces was formerly collected in
produce, and great were the consequent exactions practised upon the
natives, from which the treasury obtained no profit, but the petty
functionaries much. I believe the tax is now almost universally levied
in money. All Spaniards, all foreigners (excepting Chinese), and their
descendants are exempted from tribute. One of the most intelligent of
the merchants of Manila (Don Juan Bautista Marcaida) has had the
kindness to furnish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span>me with sundry memoranda on the subject of
the capabilities of the Philippine Islands, and the means of developing
them. To his observations, the result of careful observation, much
experience and extensive reading, I attach great value. They are imbued
with some of the national prejudices of a Spanish Catholic, in whose
mind the constitution of the Romish Church is associated with every
form of authority, and who is unwilling to see in that very
constitution, and its necessary agencies, invincible impediments to the
fullest progress of intellect&mdash;to the widest extension of
agricultural, manufacturing and commercial prosperity&mdash;in a word,
to that great agitation of the popular mind, to which Protestant
nations owe their religious reforms, and their undoubted superiority in
the vast field of speculation and adventure.</p>
<p>He says:&mdash;&ldquo;The social organization of the Philippines is
the most paternal and civilizing of any known in the world; having for
its basis the doctrines of the Gospel, and the kind and fatherly spirit
of the Laws of the Indies.&rdquo; It may be admitted, in reference to
the legislation of the colonies of many nations, that the Spanish code
is comparatively humane and that the influence of the Romish clergy has
been frequently and successfully excited for the protection and benefit
of conquered natives, and of imported slaves; but M. Marcaida goes on
to acknowledge and point out &ldquo;the torpid and unimproving
character of the existing system,&rdquo; and to demand important
changes for the advancement of the public weal. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The government moves slowly, from its complicated
organization, and from the want of adequate powers to give effect to
those reforms which are suggested by local knowledge, but which are
overruled by the unteachable ignorance, or selfish interests, or
political intrigues of the mother country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As regards the clergy, he thinks the administration generally good,
but that the progress of time and altered circumstances necessitate
many important changes in the distribution of the ecclesiastical
authority, a new arrangement of the pueblos, a better education of the
church functionaries, a great augmentation of the number of parochial
priests (many of whom have now cures varying from 3,000 to 60,000
souls). He would have the parish clergyman both the religious and
secular instructor of his community, and for this purpose requires that
he should be becomingly and highly educated&mdash;a consummation for
which the government would have some difficulty in providing the
machinery, and for which assuredly the Church would not lend its
co-operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the administration of justice, the Philippines have one
supreme and forty-two subordinate tribunals. The number is wholly
insufficient for the necessities of 5,000,000 of inhabitants scattered
over 1,200 islands, and occupying so vast a territorial space.&rdquo;
There can be no doubt that justice is often inaccessible, that it is
costly, that it is delayed, defeated, and associated with many
vexations. Spain has never been celebrated for the integrity of its
judges, or the purity of its courts. A <i>pleyto</i> in the Peninsula
is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>held to be as great a curse as a suit in
Chancery in England, with the added evil of want of confidence in the
administrators of the law. Their character would hardly be improved at
a distance of 10,000 miles from the Peninsula; and if Spain has some
difficulty in supplying herself at home with incorruptible
functionaries, that difficulty would be augmented in her remotest
possessions. There seemed to me much admirable machinery in the
traditional and still existing usages and institutions of the natives.
Much might, no doubt, be done to lessen the dilatory, costly and
troublesome character of lawsuits, by introducing more of natural and
less of technical proceedings; by facilitating the production and
examination of evidence; by the suppression of the masses of <i lang=
"es">papel sellado</i> (documents upon stamped paper); by diminishing
the cost and simplifying the process of appeal; and, above all, by the
introduction of a code applicable to the ordinary circumstances of
social life.</p>
<p>He thinks the attempts to conglomerate the population in towns and
cities injurious to the agricultural interests of the country; but
assuredly this agglomeration is friendly to civilization, good
government and the production of wealth, and more likely than the
dispersion of the inhabitants to provide for the introduction of those
larger farms to which the Philippines must look for any very
considerable augmentation of the produce of the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natural riches of the country are incalculable. There are
immense tracts of the most feracious soil; brooks, streams, rivers,
lakes, on all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>sides; mountains of minerals, metals, marbles in
vast variety; forests whose woods are adapted to all the ordinary
purposes of life; gums, roots, medicinals, dyes, fruits in great
variety. In many of the islands the cost of a sufficiency of food for a
family of five is only a cuarto, a little more than a farthing, a day.
Some of the edible roots grow to an enormous size, weighing from 50 to
70 lbs.:&mdash;gutta-percha, caoutchouc, gum-lac, gamboge, and many
other gums abound. Of fibres the number is boundless; in fact, the
known and the unknown wealth of the islands only requires fit aptitudes
for its enormous development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a few legislative reforms,&rdquo; he concludes,
&ldquo;with improved instruction of the clergy, the islands would
become a paradise of inexhaustible riches, and of a well-being
approachable in no other portion of the globe. The docility and
intelligence of the natives, their imitative virtues (wanting though
they be in forethought), make them incomparably superior to any Asiatic
or African race subjected to European authority. Where deep thought and
calculation are required, they will fail; but their natural
dispositions and tendencies, and the present state of civilization
among them, give every hope and encouragement for the
future.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12996src" href="#xd21e12996"

<p>Thus about one-tenth of the gross revenue is received by the mother
country in the following shapes:&mdash;Salaries of Spanish consuls in
the East, 22,500 dollars; remittances to Spain and bills drawn by
Spain, 680,600 dollars; tobacco and freights, 168,750 dollars; credits
to French government for advances to the imperial navy, 140,000
dollars.</p>
<p>Of the direct taxes, 68,026&middot;77 dollars are paid as tribute by
the unconverted natives, 114,604&middot;50 dollars <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>by
the mestizos (half-races), 136,208&middot;78 dollars by the Chinese,
and 1,609,757&middot;87 dollars by the Indians (or tribes professing
Christianity).</p>
<p>The produce of the customs is so small, and the expenses of
collection so great&mdash;the cost of the coast and inland preventive
service alone being 265,271&middot;99 dollars; general and provincial
administrations, between 70,000 and 80,000 dollars&mdash;that I am
persuaded it would be a sound, wise and profitable policy to abandon
this source of taxation altogether, and to declare all the ports of the
Philippines <i>free</i>.</p>
<p>I have also come to the conclusion that the monopolies, which give a
gross revenue to the treasury of more than 7,000,000 dollars, are,
independently of their vicious and retardatory action upon the public
weal, far less productive than taxation upon the same articles might be
made by their emancipation from the bonds of monopoly. I leave here out
of sight the enormous amount of fraud and crime, and the pernicious
effects upon the public morals of a universal toleration of smuggling,
as well as the consideration of all the vexations, delays, checks upon
improvement, corruption of officials and the thousand inconveniences of
fiscal interference at every stage and step; and only look at the
acknowledged cost of the machinery&mdash;it amounts to about 5,000,000
dollars&mdash;so that the net produce to the State scarcely exceeds
2,000,000 dollars.</p>
<p>The whole receipt from the tobacco monopoly is 5,097,795 dollars.
The expenses for which this department is debited are (independently of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=

<p>So that the net rendering of this most valuable production is only
1,886,042&middot;14 dollars, or 37 per cent. upon the gross amount, 63
per cent. being expended on the production of the tobacco and
manufacture of the cigars. I am of opinion that from 4,000,000 to
5,000,000 dollars might be realized with immense benefit to the public
by a tax upon cultivation, or the imposition of a simple export duty,
or by a union of both. Production would thus be largely extended,
prices moderated to the consumer and the net revenue probably more than
doubled.</p>
<p>From the produce of the lottery, 253,500 dollars, there have to be
deducted&mdash;expenses of administration, 4,472 dollars; prizes paid,
195,000 dollars; prizes not claimed, 1,000 dollars; commission on sales
of tickets, 4,680 dollars; making in all, 205,152 dollars; so that this
fertile source of misery, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>disappointment, and frequently of
crime, does not produce a net income of 50,000 dollars to the State. It
may well be doubted if such a source of revenue should be maintained.
The revenue derived from cock-fights, 86,326&middot;25 dollars, is to
some extent subject to the same condemnation, as gambling is the
foundation of both, but in the case of the <i>galleras</i> the produce
is paid without deduction into the treasury.</p>
<p>In the Bisayas palm wine has been lately made the object of a State
monopoly which produces 324,362 dollars, but is very vexatious in its
operation and much complained of by the Indians. The tax on spirituous
liquors gives 1,465,638 dollars. The opium monopoly brings
44,333&middot;34 dollars; that of gunpowder, 21,406 dollars. Of smaller
sources of income the most remarkable are&mdash;Papal bulls, giving
58,000 dollars; stamps, 39,600 dollars; fines, 30,550 dollars;
post-office stamps, 19,490 dollars; fishery in Manila harbour, 6,500
dollars.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that there are no receipts from the sale or rental
of lands. Public works, roads and bridges are in charge of the
locality, while of the whole gross revenue more than seven-tenths are
the produce of monopolies.</p>
<p>Of the government expenditure, under the head of Grace and Justice,
the clergy receive 488,329&middot;28 dollars, and for pious works
39,801&middot;83; Jesuit missions to Mindanao, 25,000. The cost of the
Audiencia is 65,556; of the alcaldes and gobernadores, 53,332 dollars.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the war department the cost of the staff is 154,148&middot;80
dollars; of the infantry, 857,031&middot;17 dollars; cavalry,
52,901&middot;73 dollars; artillery, 192,408&middot;71 dollars;
engineers, 32,173 dollars; rations, 140,644&middot;31 dollars;
<i>mat&eacute;riel</i>, 149,727&middot;10 dollars; transport, 112,000
dollars; special services, 216,673&middot;89 dollars. In the finance
expenses the sum of 310,615&middot;75 dollars appears as pensions.</p>
<p>The <i>personnel</i> of the marine department is 235,671&middot;82
dollars; cost of building, repairing, &amp;c., 266,813&middot;17
dollars; salaries, &amp;c., are 155,294&middot;98 dollars; rations,
190,740&middot;84 dollars.</p>
<p>The governor-general receives, including the secretariat, 31,056
dollars; expenses, 2,500 dollars. The heaviest charge in the section of
civil services is 120,000 dollars for the mail steamers between Hong
Kong and Manila, and 35,000 dollars for the service between Spain and
Hong Kong. There is an additional charge for the post-office of 6,852
dollars. The only receipt reported on this account is for post-office
stamps, 19,490 dollars.</p>
<p>I have made no reference to the minor details of the incomings and
outgoings of Philippine finance. The mother country has little cause to
complain, receiving as she does a net revenue of about 5s. per head
from the Indian population. In fact, about half of the whole amount of
direct taxation goes to Spain, independently of what Spanish subjects
receive who are employed in the public service. The Philippines happily
have no debt, and, considering that the Indian pays nothing for his
lands, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>cannot be said that he is heavily taxed. But
that the revenues are susceptible of immense development&mdash;that
production, agricultural and manufactured, is in a backward and
unsatisfactory state&mdash;that trade and shipping might be enormously
increased&mdash;and that great changes might be most beneficially
introduced into many branches of administration, must be obvious to the
political economist and the shrewd observer. The best evidence I can
give of a grateful remembrance of the kindnesses I received will be the
frank expression of opinions friendly to the progress and prosperity of
these fertile and improveable regions. Meliorations many and great have
already made their way; it suffices to look back upon the state of the
Philippines, &ldquo;cramped, cabined and confined&rdquo; as they were,
and to compare them with their present half-emancipated condition. No
doubt Spain has much to learn at home before she can be expected to
communicate commercial and political wisdom to her dependencies abroad.
But she may be animated by the experience she has had, and at last
discover that intercourse with opulent nations tends not to impoverish,
but to enrich those who encourage and extend that intercourse.

<h2 class="main">TAXES.</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Down to the year 1784 so unproductive were the
Philippines to the Spanish revenues, that the treasury deficit was
supplied by an annual grant of 250,000 dollars provided by the Mexican
government. A capitation tax was irregularly collected from the
natives; also a custom-house duty (<i lang="es">almojarifango</i>) on
the small trade which existed, and an excise (<i lang=
"es">alcabala</i>) on interior sales. Even to the beginning of the
present century the Spanish American colonies furnished the funds for
the military expenses of Manila. In 1829 the treasury became an
independent branch of administration. Increase of tribute-paying
population, the tobacco and wine monopoly, permission given to
foreigners to establish themselves as merchants in the capital, demand
for native and consumption of foreign productions, and a general
tendency <i>towards</i> a more liberal policy, brought about their
usual beneficial results; and, though slowly moving, the Philippines
have entered upon a career of prosperity susceptible of an enormous
extension. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>The capitation tax, or <i>tribute</i> paid by the natives, is the
foundation of the financial system in the Philippines. It is the only
direct tax (except for special cases), makes no distinction of persons
and property, has the merit of antiquity, and is collected by a
machinery provided by the Indians themselves. Originally it was levied
in produce, but compounded for by the payment of a dollar (eight
reales), raised afterwards to a dollar and a quarter, and finally the
friars have managed to add to the amount an additional fifty per cent.,
of which four-fifths are for church, and one-fifth for commercial
purposes.</p>
<p>The tribute is now due for every grown-up individual of a family, up
to the age of sixty; the local authorities (<i lang="es">cabezas de
barangay</i>), their wives and eldest or an adopted son, excepted. A
cabeza is charged with the collection of the tribute of his cabaceria,
consisting generally of about fifty persons. There are many other
exceptions, such as discharged soldiers and persons claiming exemptions
on particular grounds, to say nothing of the uncertain collections from
Indians not congregated in towns or villages, and the certain
non-collections from the wilder races. Buzeta estimates that only five
per cent. of the whole population pay the tribute. Beyond the
concentrated groups of natives there is little control; nor is the most
extended of existing influences&mdash;the ecclesiastical&mdash;at all
disposed to aid the revenue collector at the price of public
discontent, especially if the claims of the convent are recognized and
the wants of the church sufficiently provided for, which they seldom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>fail to be. The friar frequently stands between
the fiscal authority and the Indian debtor, and, as his great object is
to be popular with his flock, he, when his own expectations are
satisfied, is naturally a feeble supporter of the tax collector. The
friar has a large direct interest in the money tribute, both in the
sanctorum and the tithe; but the Indian has many means of conciliating
the padre and does not fail to employ them, and the padre&rsquo;s
influence is not only predominant, but it is perpetually present, and
in constant activity. There is a decree of 1835 allowing the Indians to
pay tribute in kind, but at rates so miserably low that I believe there
is now scarcely an instance of other than metallic payments. The
present amount levied is understood to be&mdash;</p>

China, 1,083 fled to the mountains and were kindly received and

the rest left in such a condition of discontent and misery that in 1831
the intendente made a strong representation to the government in their
favour, and in 1834 authority was given to modify the whole fiscal
legislation as regarded the Chinese.</p>
<p>The Chinese, on landing in Manila, whether as sailors or intending

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">OPENING THE NEW PORTS OF ILOILO, SUAL AND
ZAMBOANGA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The opening of the ports of Sual, Iloilo and Zamboanga
to foreign trade, was of course intended to give development to the
local interests of the northern, central and southern portions of the
archipelago, the localities selected appearing to offer the greatest
encouragements, and on the determination of the Spanish government
being known, her Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s Consul at Manila recommended
the appointment of British vice-consuls at Sual and Iloilo, and
certainly no better selections could have been made than were made on
the occasion, for the most competent gentleman in each of the ports was
fixed upon.</p>
<p>Mr. Farren&rsquo;s report, which has been laid before Parliament,
very fairly represents the claims of the new ports and their
dependencies; each has its special recommendations. The population of
the northern division, comprising Pangasinan, the two Ilocos (North and
South), Abra and La Union, may be considered among the most
industrious, opulent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331"
name="pb331">331</a>]</span>and intelligent of the Philippines. Cagayan
produces the largest quantity of the finest quality of tobacco.</p>
<p>The central division, the most thickly peopled of the whole, has
long furnished Manila with a large proportion of its exports, which, in
progress of time, will, no doubt, be sent directly from the ports of
production to those of consumption; while the southern, and the least
promising at present, has every element which soil and climate can
contribute to encourage the cultivation of vast tracts hitherto
unreached by the civilizing powers of commerce and colonization.</p>
<p>The population in the northern division is large. In Ilocos, South
and North, there are twelve towns with from 5,000 to 8,000 inhabitants;
seven with 8,000 to 12,000; seven with from 12,000 to 20,000; and three
with from 20,000 to 33,000. In Pangasinan, nine towns with from 5,000
to 12,000; seven with from 12,000 to 20,000; and three with from 20,000
to 26,000 inhabitants. The capital (Cabazera) of Cagayan has above
15,000 inhabitants. The middle zone presents a still greater number of
populous places. Zebu has fourteen towns with 5,000 to 10,000
inhabitants, and nine towns of from 10,000 to 12,000; and in Iloilo
there are seven towns with from 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants; fourteen
towns with from 10,000 to 20,000; seven with from 20,000 to 30,000; two
with from 30,000 to 40,000; and one (Haro) with 46,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>These statistics for 1857 show a great increase of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>population since Mr. Farren&rsquo;s returns and
prove that the removal of restrictions has acted most beneficially upon
the common weal, imperfect as the emancipation has been. There cannot
be a doubt that more expansive views would lead to the extension of a
liberal policy, and that mines of unexplored and undeveloped treasure
are to be found in the agricultural and commercial resources of these
regions. The importance of direct intercourse with foreign countries is
increased by the fact that, for many months of the year, the monsoons
interrupt the communication of the remoter districts with the capital.
The old spirit of monopoly not only denied to the producer the benefit
of high prices, and to the consumer the advantage of low prices, but
the trade itself necessarily fell into the hands of unenterprising and
sluggish merchants, wholly wanting in that spirit of enterprise which
is the <i lang="la">primum mobile</i> of commercial prosperity. For it
is the condition, curse and condemnation of monopoly, that while it
narrows the vision and cramps the intellect of the monopolist, it
delivers the great interests of commerce to the guardianship of an
inferior race of traders, excluding those higher qualities which are
associated with commercial enterprise when launched upon the wide ocean
of adventurous and persevering energy. How is the tree to reach its
full growth and expansion whose branches are continually lopped off
lest their shadows should extend, and their fruit fall for the benefit
of others than its owner? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=
"#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span></p>
<p>But in reference to the beneficial changes which have been
introduced, their value has been greatly diminished by the imperfect
character of the concessions. They should have been complete; they
should, while opening the ports to foreign trade, have allowed that
trade full scope and liberty. The discussions which have taken place
have, however, been eminently useful, and the part taken in favour of
commercial freedom by Mr. Bosch and Mr. Loney, both British
vice-consuls, has been creditable to their zeal and ability. In the
Philippines, the tendency of public opinion is decidedly in the right
direction. The resistance which for so many years, or even centuries,
opposed the admission of strangers to colonial ports, no doubt was
grounded upon the theory that they would bring less of trade than they
would carry away&mdash;that they would participate in the large profits
of those who held the monopoly, but not confer upon them any
corresponding or countervailing advantages.</p>
<p>Mr. Farren states that, in 1855, &ldquo;the British trade with the
Philippines exceeded in value that of Great Britain with several of the
States of Europe, with that of any one State or port in Africa, was
greater than the British trade with Mexico, Columbia, or Guatemala, and
nearly ranked in the second-class division of the national trade with
Asia, the total value of exports and imports approaching three millions
sterling. The export of sugar to Great Britain and her colonies was, in
1854, 42,400 tons, that to Great Britain alone having gradually grown
upon the exports of 1852, which was 5,061 tons, to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>27,254 tons, which exceeds the exports to the
whole world in 1852. The imports of British goods and manufactures,
which was 427,020<i>l.</i> in value in 1845, exceeded
1,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling in 1853.&rdquo; It still progresses, and
the removal of any one restriction, the encouragement of any one
capability, will add to that progress, and infallibly augment the
general prosperity.</p>
<p>The statistics of the island of Panay for 1857 give to the province
of Iloilo 527,970; to that of Capiz, 143,713; and to that of Antique,
77,639; making in all 749,322, or nearly three-quarters of a million of
inhabitants. The low lands of Capiz are subject to frequent
inundations. It has a fine river, whose navigation is interfered with
by a sandbank at its mouth. The province is productive, and gives two
crops of rice in the year. The harbours of Batan and of Capiz (the
cabacera) are safe for vessels of moderate size. The inhabitants of
Antique, which occupies all the western coast of Panay, are the least
industrious of the population of the island. The coast is dangerous. It
has two pueblos, Bugason and Pandan, with more than 10,000 souls. The
cabacera San Jos&eacute; has less than half that number. The roads of
the provinces are bad and communications with Iloilo difficult. The
lands are naturally fertile, but have not been turned to much account
by the Indians. There are only forty-two mestizos in the province.
There is a small pearl and turtle fishery, and some seaslugs are caught
for the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Iloilo has, no doubt, been fixed on as the seat of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>the
government, from the facilities it offers to navigation; but it is much
smaller, less opulent and even less active than many of the towns in
its neighbourhood. The province of Iloilo is, on the whole, perhaps the
most advanced of any in the Philippines, excepting the immediate
neighbourhood of the capital. It has fine mountainous scenery, richly
adorned with forest trees, while the plains are eminently fertile. All
tropical produce appears to flourish. The manufacturing industry of the
women is characteristic, and has been referred to in other places,
especially with reference to the extreme beauty of the pi&ntilde;a
fabric. Of the mode of preparing the fabric Mallat gives this
account:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is from the leaves of the pine-apple&mdash;the plant which
produces such excellent fruits&mdash;that the white and delicate
threads are drawn which are the raw material of the <i>nipis</i> or
pi&ntilde;a stuffs. The sprouts of ananas are planted, which sometimes
grow under the fruit to the number of a dozen; they are torn off, and
are set in a light soil, sheltered, if possible, and they are watered
as soon as planted. After four months the crown is removed, in order to
prevent the fruiting, and that the leaves may grow broader and longer.
At the age of eight months they are an ell in length, and six fingers
in breadth, when they are torn away and stretched out on a plank, and,
while held by his foot, the Indian with a piece of broken earthenware
scrapes the pulp till the fibres appear. These are taken by the middle,
and cautiously raised from one end to the other; they are washed twice
or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>thrice in water, dried in the air and cleaned;
they are afterwards assorted according to their lengths and qualities.
Women tie the separate threads together in packets, and they are ready
for the weaver&rsquo;s use. In the weaving it is desirable to avoid
either too high or too low a temperature&mdash;too much drought, or too
much humidity&mdash;and the most delicate tissues are woven under the
protection of a mosquito net. Such is the patience of the weaver, that
she sometimes produces not more than half an inch of cloth in a day.
The finest are called <i lang="tl">pinilian</i>, and are only made to
order. Ananas are cultivated solely for the sake of the fibre, which is
sold in the market. Most of the stuffs are very narrow; when figured
with silk, they sell for about 10<i>s.</i> per yard. The plain,
intended for embroidery, go to Manila, where the most extravagant
prices are paid for the finished work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vice-Consul Bosch has written an interesting report on the
capabilities of the province of Pangasinan, and of Sual, its principal
port. The circumference of coast is from fifty to sixty miles on the
south and east of the Gulf of Lingayen. The interior abounds with
facilities for water communication, and the most important river, the
Agno, enters the sea at St. Isidro, about one and a half mile from
Sual. The Agno has about seventy to eighty miles of internal
navigation, and brings produce from the adjacent provinces of La Union
and Nueva Ecija, The exports to Manila are generally made from Sual,
those for China from Dagupan. Dagupan is at the mouth of a large
estuary, but a bar prevents <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href=
"#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>the entry of any large vessel. The
want of safe anchorage is the disadvantage of all the coast of the
province, with the exception of the harbour of Sual. This harbour,
though small, is safe: it is nearly circular. It would hold from twelve
to fifteen large vessels and thirty to forty coasters, and is well
protected on every side, but there is a somewhat dangerous bank within
the port.</p>
<p>There are only about 400 houses in Sual: they are scattered on the
plain in front of the harbour, and are of wood. There are, besides, 100
Indian huts (<i>chozas</i>) constructed of the nipa palm. The church is
a poor, provisional edifice.</p>
<p>Sual is exhibiting some signs of improvement. The road to the
neighbouring province of Zambales is in progress. The allied forces in
Cochin China have been lately drawing provisions, especially cattle,
from Sual. The value of the exports from Sual, for 1858, is 670,095
dollars; the imports of foreign goods and manufactures into the three
ports of the province&mdash;Dagupan, Binmaley and Lingayen&mdash;amount
to 464,116 dollars, all brought by coasting vessels, of which 75 belong
to the province. The largest pueblo of the province is San Carlos, with
26,376 inhabitants; the second, Binmaley, with 24,911; the third,
Lingayen, with 23,063; but the population of Sual is only 3,451. Rice
and sugar are the leading articles of produce exported, but there is at
Calasiao a considerable manufacture of hats, cigar-cases, mats and
other fabrics of the various fibres of the country. There are no large
estates, nor manufactures <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href=
"#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>on an extensive scale. Everything
is done by small proprietors and domestic industry. There are many
places where markets (called <i>tiangues</i>) are periodically held,
and articles of all sorts brought thither for sale. It is calculated
that Pangasinan could give 20,000 tons of rice for exportation, after
providing for local wants. The sugar, though it might be produced
abundantly, is carelessly prepared. Much wood is cut for ship-building
and other purposes. On the arrival of the N. E. monsoon commercial
enterprise begins and many shipments take place; the roads are
passable, the warehouses filled with goods: this lasts till the end of
June or July. Then come on the heavy rains: the vessels for the
coasting trade are laid up for the season; the rivers overflow; most of
the temporary bridges are carried away by the floods; everybody is
occupied by what the Spaniards call their &ldquo;interior life;&rdquo;
they settle the accounts of the past year and prepare for that which is
to come, and the little foreign trade of Sual is the only evidence of
trading activity.</p>
<p>Labour is moderately remunerated. Taking fifty ship carpenters,
employed in one yard, the least paid had 5 rials, the highest 10 rials
per week (say 3<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i>). They are also allowed two
measures of rice and a little meat or fish. A field labourer (or
<i>peon</i>) has a rial a day and his food. A cart with a buffalo and
leader costs 1&frac12; rial per day.</p>
<p>Almost all purchases are made by brokers (<i lang=
"es">personeros</i>), who, for a commission, generally of 5 per
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>cent., and a guarantee of 2&frac12; per cent.,
collect the products of the country from the cultivators, to whom they
make advances&mdash;always in silver; and it sometimes passes through
many hands before it reaches the labouring producer.</p>
<p>There are few native Spaniards in Pangasinan. A good many mestizos
are devoted to commerce. In Lingayen, with 23,000 inhabitants, there
are more than 1,000 mestizos; in Binmaley, with 24,000 inhabitants,
only twenty-two mestizos: the first being a trading, the second an
agricultural, pueblo. There are few Indians who have acquired opulence.
The Chinese element has penetrated, and they obtain more and more
influence as active men of business. No Oriental race can compete with
them where patience, perseverance and economy can be brought into play.
They are not liked; but they willingly suffer much annoyance and spread
and strengthen themselves by unanimity of purpose. In Calasiao they are
said in two years to have established nearly eighty shops, and were
gradually insinuating themselves into all profitable
occupations&mdash;attending the markets both as buyers and sellers, and
establishing relations with the interior such as no native Indian would
have ever contemplated. Nor in the ordinary transactions of life do
they make the mistake of requiring extravagant profits. A Chinaman may,
indeed, ask a high price or offer a low one in his different relations,
but when he sees his way to a clear profit, he will not let the bargain
escape him. There is an increasing demand for European merchandise,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>of which the Chinese are the principal
importers; and they, above all other men, are likely to open new
channels of trade. The current rate of interest is 10 per cent.; though
the church funds are lent at 6 per cent. to those whom the clergy are
disposed to favour, which indeed is the legal rate.</p>
<p>Mr. Bosch&rsquo;s return for the year 1858 shows that eight large
vessels, with 7,185 tons, and 282 coasters, with 7,780 tons, entered
the port of Sual. Only four of the former carried cargoes away, two
having gone to repair damages, and two being Spanish government
steamers for the remittal to Manila of money which amounted to 210,000
dollars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We steamed away from Manila on the 20th December. It
was our first purpose to visit Labuan, which had become of some
interest to me as Governor of Hong Kong, having been made of late the
penal settlement for a certain number of Chinese convicts. Two groups
of sixty each had been sent thither, and the Governor was desirous
their number should be increased. I do not see how the settlement can
be made a prosperous or productive one. The coals which it furnishes
are not liked by our engineers, and seldom employed if English or Welsh
coals can be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>obtained. A considerable quantity was reported
to me as raised and lying on the shore without demand, but I found no
willingness, either on the part of the naval authorities or of the
merchants, to purchase it. I expect both China and Japan will be in a
condition to provide this very important article on cheaper terms and
of better quality than that of Labuan, or any part of Borneo. I should
have been glad to have had an opportunity of forming an opinion,
grounded on my own observations, as to the prospects of Sarawak. I am
disposed to believe the Government has acted judiciously in refusing to
buy the colony, and to encumber the treasury with the charges which its
establishments would inevitably entail. The arguments which I have seen
put forward in its favour by the advocates of the purchase, have
certainly little weight. To represent the locality as of any importance
as a place of call between Europe and China, is to display
extraordinary geographical and commercial ignorance: it is hundreds of
miles out of the regular course, and has in itself no attraction to
induce any vessel to waste the time which must be expended in visiting
it. It has a fertile soil, which may be said of the whole circumjacent
region&mdash;of almost every island in the tropical archipelagos; but
it must depend principally on imported labour, costly and capricious in
its supply, and which must be directed by European machinery, still
more costly and uncertain, for the climate is, and will long continue,
unfriendly to the health of European settlers. The native population is
too barbarous to labour; with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343"
href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>few wants, they have few
motives to exertion. I have had the advantage of much conversation with
the Catholic Vicar Apostolic of Borneo, whose knowledge of the natives
is probably greater than that of any other European, as he has lived so
much among them in the discharge of the duties of his mission. He
represents the different tribes as engaged in perpetual wars with one
another, each taking any opportunity of pillaging or doing mischief to
its neighbours; and our involving ourselves in the native quarrels, by
ill-judged partisanship, must lead, he thinks, to much cruelty and
injustice. He gave me many particulars of the savage practices of which
he had been an eye-witness, particularly in the displays and
processions of human heads as trophies of victory. Although I had not
an opportunity of visiting Borneo and of witnessing there the progress
that has been made under European influences, I have had so many means
of studying the character of the native and unsubdued races in the
territories of Spain and the Netherlands, that I feel quite justified
in the conclusion, that little is to be expected from their
co-operation, either as producers of tropical, or consumers of
European, articles. The great element which is now revolutionizing
these regions, is the introduction of Chinese labour, which has
received a check not easily to be surmounted in the unfortunate
outbreak at Sarawak, after the events in Canton; but the introduction
of the Chinese must be spontaneous, and not forced. The Chinese
field-labourer works unwillingly for a master who is to receive the
profits of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>his labour; but far different are his feelings,
his activity and perseverance, when the profits are all to be his own.
Then, indeed, he becomes a valuable settler, from whom much is to be
expected. Our new treaties&mdash;the presence of British shipping in so
many ports of China&mdash;the supersession of the heavy junks by the
square-rigged vessels of the West, which the habit of insuring that the
Chinese are now adopting cannot fail to promote&mdash;will all assist
in the transfer of the surplus population of China to regions where
their industry will find a wider scope and a more profitable field. The
adventurous spirit in China is becoming more and more active. The tens
of thousands who have emigrated to California and Australia, and the
thousands who have returned with savings which they have deemed a
sufficiency, have given an impulse to the emigrating passion, which
will act strongly and beneficially in all countries towards which it
may be directed. In process of time, and with the co-operation of the
mandarins, who are really interested in the removal of a wretched,
sometimes starving and always discontented, social element, the
difficulties attaching to the removal of females may in time be
surmounted, and the Chinese may perpetuate, what they have never yet
done, a Chinese community in the lands where they settle. No doubt the
mestizo mixture of races&mdash;the descendants of Chinese fathers and
Indian mothers&mdash;is now extensively spread, and is a great
improvement upon the pure Malay or Indian breed. The type of the father
is more strongly preserved than that of the mother; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>its
greater vigour has given it predominance. The Chinese mestizo is
physically a being superior to the Indian&mdash;handsomer in person,
stronger in limb, more active in intellect, more persevering in labour,
more economical in habits. The marvellous exodus of Chinese from their
country is one of the most remarkable ethnological circumstances of
modern history, and is producing and will produce extraordinary and
lasting results. I do not believe any of the other Oriental races able
to withstand the secret and widely spreading influences of Chinese
competition and superiority. Dealt with justly and fairly, the Chinese
are the most manageable of men, but they will be dangerous where
despotism drives them to despair.</p>
<p>On the sixth day of our voyage we arrived at Zamboanga. Indian
houses were visible through the plantain trees, and amidst the
woodlands of the coast, and a large fortification, with the yellow and
scarlet Spanish flag, advised us of our adjacency to the seat of
government. We sent on shore, and found the guns and the garrison were
not in a condition to return our salute, but we received an early and
cordial communication from the governor, Colonel Navarro, inviting us
to take up our abode at his residence, and we landed at a convenient
wooden pier, which is carried out for some distance into the harbour.
There was a small body of soldiers to meet us on landing. In walking
about we found one street wholly occupied by Chinese shopkeepers, well
supplied with European and Chinese wares; they generally <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>appeared contented and prosperous, and will
certainly find the means of supplying whatever the population may
demand; they will leave nothing undone which is likely to extend their
trade or augment their profits. There are about three hundred Chinese
settled in Zamboanga, mostly men of Fokien. We walked to the
fortification, and on our way met several of the Mahomedan women who
had been captured in a late fray with natives; their breasts were
uncovered, and they wore not the veils which almost invariably hide the
faces of the daughters of Islam. We learnt that these females were of
the labouring and inferior classes; but in the fortification we saw the
wives and children of the chiefs, who had been captured, and they
presented the most marvellous contrasts, between the extreme ugliness
of the aged and the real beauty of some of the young. One mother
especially, who had a child on her haunches, appeared to me singularly
graceful and pleasing. Most of the captured chiefs had been sent to
Manila; but in another part of the fortress there were some scores of
prisoners, among whom, one seemed to exercise ascendency over the rest,
and he repeated some of the formula of the Koran in Arabic words. The
Spaniards represented them as a fierce, faithless and cruel race, but
they have constantly opposed successful resistance to their
invaders.</p>
<p>Next to Luzon, Mindanao is the largest of the Philippines. Though
its surface is 3,200 square leagues in extent, the Spaniards do not
occupy one-tenth of the whole. The number of Mahomedans <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>(<i>Moros</i>) is great in the interior, and
they are the subjects of an independent Sultan, whose capital is
Selangan, and who keeps up amicable relations with the Spanish
authorities. To judge by some of their native manufactures which I saw
at Zamboanga, they are by no means to be considered as barbarians. The
inland country is mountainous, but has some fine lakes and rivers
little visited by strangers. There are many spacious bays. Storms and
earthquakes are frequent visitants. The forests are said to be
extensive, and filled with gigantic trees, but travellers report the
jungle to be impenetrable. Mines of gold, quicksilver and sulphur are
said to abound. Besides Zamboanga, the Spaniards have settlements in
Misamis, Caraga and New Guipuzcoa, but they are reported to be
unhealthy from the immense putrefaction of decaying vegetables produced
by a most feracious soil, under the influence of a tropical sun. Beyond
the Moros, and in the wildest parts of the mountains, are coloured
races in a low state of savage existence. Mindanao was one of the
earliest conquests of Magallanes (1521). The Augustine friars were the
first missionaries, and they still retain almost a monopoly of
religious instruction, but their success among the Mahomedans has been
small. Many attempts have been made by the Spaniards to subdue the
interior, but, however great their temporary success, they have never
been able long to maintain themselves against the fanaticism of the
Moros, the dangers and difficulties of the country and the climate,
while supported only by inadequate military means. Misamis <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>is
used as a penal settlement. The Spaniards have not penetrated far into
the interior of this part of the island, which is peopled by a race of
Indians said not to be hostile, but, being frequently at war with the
more formidable Mahomedans, they are considered by the Spaniards as
affording them some protection, their locality dividing the European
settlements from the territory of the Moors. But there is little
development of agriculture or industry, and not one inhabitant in ten
of the province pays tribute. The Jesuits had formerly much success in
these regions; on their expulsion the Recolets (barefooted Augustines)
occupied their places, but it would seem with less acceptance. The
settlers and the Indians recognizing the Spanish authority have been so
frequently molested by the Moors that their numbers are far less than
they were formerly, and it is believed the revenues are quite
inadequate to pay the expenses of the establishments; but it is said
some progress is being made, and if all impediments to commercial
intercourse were removed, a great amelioration in the condition and
prospects of the natives would result. Caraga, from which New Guipuzcoa
has been lately detached, has Surigao for its capital, and is on the
north-east corner of the island. The dominions of the Sultan of
Mindanao mark the limits of the province. A race of Indians remarkable
for the whiteness of their skin, and supposed to be of Japanese
descent, called Tago-balvoys, live on the borders of a creek in the
neighbourhood of a town bearing the name of Bisig, a station of the
Recolets. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>Some of this race pay tribute, and live in a
state of constant hostility with the Moros. They are advanced in
civilization beyond the neighbouring tribes. Butuan, in this province,
was the last landing place of Magallanes; he planted a cross there, and
the Indians took part in the ceremonials, and profess Christianity to
the present hour. The Moros have destroyed some of the earlier
establishments of the Spaniards. There are immense tracts of
uncultivated and fertile lands. Teak is reported to abound in the
forests, which are close to the habitations of the settlers. The
orang-utan is common, and there are many varieties of apes and monkeys,
wild beasts, particularly buffaloes and deer, and several undescribed
species of quadrupeds. The Spaniards say that the province of Caraga is
the richest of the Philippines; it is certainly one of the least
explored. A Frenchman has been engaged in working the gold mines; I
know not with what success. A favourite food of the natives is the wild
honey, which is collected in considerable quantities, and eaten with
fruits and roots. The Butuan River is navigable for boats. There are
very many separate races of natives, among whom the Mandayos are said
to be handsome, and to bear marks of European physiognomy. Some of the
tribes are quite black, fierce and ungovernable. Cinnamon and pepper
are believed to be indigenous. Wax, musk and tortoise-shell are
procurable, but as the Spanish settlements are not much beyond the
coast little is done for the encouragement of the productive powers of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>interior. Gold, however, no doubt from the
facility of its transport, is not an unimportant article of export, and
the Spaniards complain that the natives attend to nothing else, so that
there is often much suffering from dearth, and the insalubrity of the
climate deters strangers from locating themselves. This is little to be
wondered at, as the attacks of pirates are frequent and the powers of
government weak. Along the coasts are towers provided with arms and
ammunition for their defence; but the pirates frequently interrupt the
communications by sea, on which the inhabitants almost wholly depend,
there being no passable roads. On the approach of the piratical boats
the natives generally abandon their own and flee to the mountains.
There are many Mahomedan tribes who take no part in these outrages,
such as the Bagobos, Cuamanes and others. Even the mails are
interrupted by the pirates, and often delayed for days in localities
where they seek shelter. All these drawbacks notwithstanding, the
number of tributaries is said to have greatly increased, and the
influence of the friars to have extended itself. I have compared
various statistical returns, and find many contradictions and
inconsistencies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13555src" href=
"#xd21e13555" name="xd21e13555src">1</a> Some evidence that little
progress has been made is seen in the fact that in the province of
Surigao, where the census gives 18,848 Indians, there are only 148
mestizos; in that of Misamis, only 266 mestizos to 46,517 Indians; in
Zamboanga, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>10,191 Indians, 16 mestizos; Basilan, 447
Indians and 4 mestizos; Bislig, 12,718 Indians and 21 mestizos; Davao,
800 Indians, no mestizo. This state of things assuredly proves that the
island of Mindanao, whatever be its fertility, has few attractions for
strangers, otherwise the proportion of the mixed races to the
population would be very different from what it appears to be. Father
Zu&ntilde;iga, who, in 1799, published an account of the visit of
General Alava, gives many particulars of the then state of the island,
and suggests many plans for extending Spanish influence.</p>
<p>Zamboanga is not likely to become a port of much importance unless
it is wholly emancipated from fiscal restrictions. The introduction of
the custom-house has driven away the whalers that formerly visited the
harbours; there is little capital, and the trading establishments are
on a very small scale. The roads in the immediate neighbourhood are in
very tolerable order; the villages have the general character of Indian
pueblos; the country is rich in all the varieties of tropical
vegetation; but the interior, even close to the cabaceras, is
imperfectly known. Its produce is small in reference to the obvious
fertility of the soil. Some companies of troops arrived during our stay
at Zamboanga, and it is probable an effort is to be made to strengthen
and widen the authority of the Spanish government.</p>
<p>Of the arms used by the Moros the governor had a large collection,
consisting of long spears, swords of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>various forms,
handsomely adorned kreeses, daggers and knives displaying no small
amount of manufacturing art.</p>
<p>Confined as the Spaniards are to a narrow strip of land along the
coast, it may be supposed there are few conveniences for locomotion,
nevertheless a carriage was found, and a pair of horses, and harness
such as it was, and an Indian driver, and thus we managed to obtain a
very pleasant evening ride into the country, and had an opportunity of
seeing its great fertility and its varied productions, leading to
natural feelings of regret that so many of the boons of Providence
should remain unenjoyed and unimproved, accompanied with the hope that
better days may dawn. But the world is full of undeveloped treasures,
and its &ldquo;Yarrows unvisited&rdquo; promise a bright futurity.</p>
<p>There would seem to have been some increase in the population of
Zamboanga. In 1779 Zu&ntilde;iga reports it to be 5,612 souls,
&ldquo;including Indians, Spaniards, soldiers and convicts;&rdquo; in
1818 the number is stated to have been 8,640; in 1847, 7,190. The Guia
of 1850 gives 8,618; that of 1858, 10,191, of whom 16 were mestizos,
and tribute-payers 3,871; but I do not think much reliance can be
placed on the statistical returns. The last states that the marriages
were 55, the births 429, the deaths 956, which represents a fearful
mortality. In the province of Misamis for the same period the
proportion of births to deaths was 2,155 to 845.</p>
<p>A great value is attached to some of the canes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>which are found on the island of Palawan, or
Paragua, especially where they are of variegated colours, or pure
white, and without the interruption of a knot, so as to serve for
walking-sticks. I was informed that two hundred dollars had been given
for a fine specimen.</p>
<p>A gold-headed sticky with a silk cord and tassels, is the emblem of
authority in the Philippines. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354"

<p>Of the three ports lately opened to foreign commerce, Iloilo is the
most promising. The province of Iloilo is one of the most populous of
the Philippines. It contains more than half a million of inhabitants,
and though portions of the province are very thinly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>peopled, there is an average exceeding 2,000
inhabitants per square league. Independently of the pueblos which I
visited, and of which some description will be given, Cabatuan has
23,000 inhabitants, Miagao 31,000, Dumangas 25,000, Janiuay 22,000,
Pototan 34,600, and several others more than 10,000 souls. The province
is not only one of the most numerously peopled, it is, perhaps, the
most productive in agricultural, the most active in manufacturing,
industry, and among the best instructed of the Philippines.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13592src" href="#xd21e13592" name=
"xd21e13592src">1</a> It has extensive and cultivated plains and
forest-covered mountains; its roads are among the best I have seen in
the archipelago. At the entrance of the channel are a number of islands
called the Seven (mortal) Sins&mdash;<i lang="es">Los Siete
Pecados</i>. The large island of Guimaras limits the channel on the
south; it was visited by some of our party, who returned delighted with
the extensive stalactite caverns which they explored, reaching them
with some difficulty over the rocks, through the woods and across the
streams which arrested their progress. The forests are full of game and
the river Cabatuan abounds with crocodiles. There are many rivulets and
rivers which greatly assist the cultivator, and we found a good supply
of cattle. The ponies of Iloilo are among the best in the archipelago,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>some attention is paid to the breeding of sheep.
A good deal of salt is made, and there is a considerable fishery of
<i>trepang</i> (sea-slug) and tortoises for the sake of the shells. But
the island is most renowned for the pi&ntilde;a fabrics called nipas
and sinamays, some of which are of exquisite fineness and beauty; they
are largely exported, and their perfection has given them a vast
reputation even in Europe.</p>
<p>On the arrival of the Spaniards they found the district occupied by
painted Indians, full of superstitions, which, notwithstanding the
teachings of the Augustine friars, are still found to prevail,
especially at the time of any public calamity. They are among the best
formed of the Indians, speak a dialect of the Bisayan, which they
called <i>Hiligueyna</i>, but in the remoter parts another idiom named
the <i>Halayo</i> prevails. The Augustines boast of having converted
fifty thousand families in 1566, but they were not able to induce them
to cultivate their lands and to store their surplus produce, and the
locusts having desolated the district, in the two following years more
than half the population perished of hunger. But the missionaries made
no progress among the <i>Negritos</i> who dwelt in the wilder parts of
the mountainous regions, and who were joined by many desiring to escape
from the authority of the invaders. These savages have not unfrequently
attacked the villages of the converted Indians, but of late years have
found it more prudent and profitable to bring down their wax and pitch,
and exchange them for rice and garments. They have no general ruler,
but each <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>clan has its recognized head, and it is said
that, when perplexed as to choice of a successor to a departed chief,
they send deputations to the missionaries and ask their advice and
assistance to regulate their choice. Formerly the district was
frequently attacked by pirates, who committed great ravages and
destroyed several towns. In 1716 the Dutch attacked the fortress of
Iloilo, but were compelled to retire after a heavy loss both in killed
and wounded. There has been a great increase in the population, which
in 1736 numbered 67,708 souls; in 1799, 176,901; in 1845, 277,571; and
by the last census, 527,970, of whom 174,874 pay tribute. There is a
small number of Spaniards&mdash;of mestizos many, of whom the larger
proportion are <i>sangleys</i>, the descendants of Chinese fathers and
native mothers. The increase of the population must be great, the
census in 1857 giving 17,675 births, and only 9,231 deaths.</p>
<p>The approach to Iloilo is by a channel between a sandbank (which has
spread nearly a mile beyond the limits given in the charts) and the
island of Guimaras. The town appears adjacent as it is approached, but
the river by which vessels enter makes a considerable bend and passes
round close to the town. We observed a large fortification, but it had
not the means of saluting us, and we were therefore exonerated from the
duty of exploding H. M.&rsquo;s gunpowder; but if not in the shape of
noisy salutations, the courtesies of the Spanish authorities were
displayed in every possible way towards the officers and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>crew
of our frigate, for whose service and entertainment everything was
done. We were soon waited on by a gentleman from the British
vice-consulate. The vice-consul returned to Iloilo the day after our
arrival. It would indeed be well if all British functionaries possessed
as much aptitude, knowledge and disposition to be useful as we found in
Mr. Loney, to whom the commerce of the Philippines generally, and the
port of Iloilo especially, is under great obligations. To him, more
than to any other individual, the development of the trade of Panay
will be due.</p>
<p>From the Governor of Iloilo, Colonel Jos&eacute; Maria
Carl&egrave;s, especially I experienced great kindness. He was
Buffering under a sore affliction&mdash;for affliction holds sway over
every part of the world&mdash;the loss of an only and beloved son who
had preceded him as governor of the province and was an object of so
much affection that the people earnestly implored the Captain-General
to allow the father to succeed him, which was granted. It was touching
to hear the tales of the various displays of popular sympathy and
sorrow which accompanied the death and the interment of Don Emilio
Carl&egrave;s, whom no less than fifty carriages followed to his grave
in Ar&eacute;valo. I passed the village more than once with the
mourning father; at a time, too, when sorely suffering from sorrows of
my own, I felt the consolation which is found in remembering and
helping others to remember the virtues of the dead. These are their
best monuments, though not written on tablets of stone. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span></p>
<p>The principalia of Molo came to invite us to a ball, and very
prettily the ball was got up. It is a most industrious locality; in
ancient times was a Chinese colony, and is now occupied by mestizos and
their descendants, most of them having a mingling of Chinese blood. The
pueblo has 16,428 inhabitants, of whom the mestizos are 1,106. It is
one of the busiest towns in the island, and everything has a prosperous
and active look. Some of the buildings have in the same apartment many
looms occupied in making the pi&ntilde;a stuffs. The place was gaily
illuminated on occasion of the ball, and the gobernadorcillo made an
oration in Spanish to the effect that the locality had been much
honoured by our presence, and that the memory of the day would be long
preserved. Many of the mestizos keep their carriages, which were placed
at the disposal of our friends, and which fell into the procession when
music and firing of guns and muskets accompanied us through the town.
Molo is an island formed by two creeks, and entered by bridges on both
sides. I believe it is one of the few localities served by a secular
curate. It is about four miles from Iloilo, the road being good, and
many Indian houses are seen on both sides of the way. Almost all these
have their gardens growing plantains, cocoa-nuts, bread-fruits, cocoa,
betel and other vegetable productions. Sugar planting appeared to be
extending, and there are many paddy-fields and much cultivation of
maize.</p>
<p>The Governor and British vice-consul accompanied <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span>us
in our pleasant excursions to the interior, during which we visited
some of the most populous pueblos of the provinces. We travelled in
comfortable carriages, the friars or the gobernadorcillos providing us
with relays of horses, and the convents were generally the places
appointed for our reception, in which we invariably found most
hospitable cheer. One day it was determined to visit Janiuay, and we
first stopped at Jaro, a pueblo of more than 22,000 souls. The roads
had their usual adornings: the Indian cottages exhibited their flags,
the equestrian principalia came out to escort us, and the native bands
of music went before us when we entered and when we quitted the
populous part of the town. Jaro is deemed the most opulent place in the
island of Panay. It was founded in 1584 or 1585. Cultivation extends to
some distance around it. It boasts of its stone bridge, more than 700
feet in length and 36 feet in breadth, the erection of which, as well
as the excellent roads by which the pueblo is approached, are due to
the munificence of a curate knighted by his sovereign for his patriotic
sacrifices. Though the country is level, the rich vegetation on the
banks of the streams and by the borders of the highway make the scenery
picturesque. The manufacture of fine stuffs and cotton, pi&ntilde;a and
silk, is very considerable. These fabrics are exposed for sale at a
weekly market, held on Thursdays, which is crowded by people from every
part of the province, being the largest of the Iloilo marts. From Jaro
we proceeded to Santa Barbara, a pueblo of 23,000 souls. Here we were
received at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span>the convent of the Augustine friars, in whose
hands are all the cures of Iloilo, to one of whom we had the pleasure
of giving a passage to Manila, whither he was bound as the delegate to
the annual assembly of the fraternity. Here, too, other Augustine
friars visited us, all inviting us to partake of the hospitalities of
their spacious convents. Santa Barbara is a modern town, built in 1759,
and placed under the special protection of the saint whose name it
bears. It has shared in the general prosperity of the province: in 1820
it had no manufactures; but it has now a weekly market for the sale of
the produce of its looms, consisting principally of cottons,
sail-canvas, quilts, coverlets, &amp;c. The forests furnish fine timber
for building and for cabinet work, and are crowded with wild bees,
whose wax and honey form a considerable article of traffic. Excellent
were the carriages and horses of the friars. Our next resting-place was
Cabatuan, somewhat larger than Santa Barbara. Cabatuan was founded in
1732. It is on the banks of the river Tiguin; sometimes nearly dry, and
at others deluging the country with its impetuous torrents. The
numerous crocodiles make fishing unsafe; and the navigation even of
small boats is often interrupted, either by the superfluity or
insufficiency of its waters. There is a large production of rice and of
cocoa-nut oil for lighting. From Cabatuan we went to Janiuay, which was
the limit of the day&rsquo;s journey, and of our visit to the interior.
It is called Matagul in the ancient maps of the province, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>has about the same number of inhabitants as
Santa Barbara. The convent and church are on a slightly elevated
ground, and offer a pretty view of the pueblo and surrounding country.
Many of the women are engaged in the labours of the loom, but
agriculture is the principal industry of the neighbourhood. We had
hoped to visit the Dingle mountain, one of whose caves or grottos is
said to present the character of a temple of fantastic architecture,
adorned with rock crystal and exhibiting masses of marble and alabaster
which form its walls; another cave is formed of granite, which abounds
in the locality: but we had to return to Iloilo to meet the principal
people at a late dinner, succeeded as usual by a ball. The
Governor&rsquo;s house being at some distance from the town, we were
kindly accommodated at that of one of the native merchants,
conveniently situated on the quay of the river. Several of the friars,
who had been our hosts, were the guests of the merchants; and the kind
hospitality we experienced did not justify the constant expression of
courteous regrets for the inadequacy of the entertainment, the blunders
of the native servants (sometimes amusing enough), and the contrasts
between the accommodations of Europe and those which a remote Spanish
settlement in the Philippines could afford; but there was so much of
courtesy, good breeding and cordiality that it was impossible to feel
otherwise than grateful and contented, and, after all, in this world to
do all we can is to discharge every duty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb363" href="#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next day we made our arrangements for visiting the different
pueblos on the coast, and, starting in our carriages soon after
daybreak, we passed through Molo and Ar&eacute;valo to Oton.
Ar&eacute;valo has some celebrity in the annals of the Philippines, and
had a special interest for the Governor, as here had been lately
displayed the affection of the Indians for his son, whose funeral they
had honoured with such special marks of sympathy and regret.
Ar&eacute;valo was formerly the residence of the governor&mdash;built
by Ronquillo in 1581, who gave it the name of his birth-place. Molested
by the Indians, attacked by pirates and the government quite
disorganized, it was for a long time abandoned; and the seat of
authority being removed to Iloilo, Ar&eacute;valo presents few signs of
activity: there are about 8,000 inhabitants in this district. At Oton
we saw from the Augustine convent an interesting ceremony. It was on a
Sunday; and on quitting the church the inhabitants were summoned by
beat of drum to attend the reading of a proclamation of the government.
They were all in their holiday garments, and men, women and children
formed a circle round one of the native Indian authorities, who, in a
loud voice, read in the Bisayan tongue the document which he had been
ordered to communicate to the people. There was perfect silence during
the reading, and a quiet dispersion of the crowd. Fortifications are
erected along the coast, and a great variety of manufactures were
brought to us for examination. A good deal of English cotton twist is
sold, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>forms the warp of most of the fabrics.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13641src" href="#xd21e13641" name=
"xd21e13641src">2</a> There were rugs of silk and cotton; varieties of
coloured ginghams; tissues, in which the fibres of the abac&aacute; and
the pi&ntilde;a were mixed with our cotton thread, whose importation
is, however, confined to the colours which the Indians are themselves
not able to dye. Oton has nearly 23,000 inhabitants. I observe the
proportion of births to deaths is as nearly four to one, and that while
there are five births to one marriage, the deaths exceed the marriages
by less than one-third, so that the increase of population must be very
great. In 1818, it was less than 9,000. Tigbauan, with its 21,000
inhabitants, was our next halting place. Its general character
resembles that of Oton. Rice is the principal agricultural production,
but the women are mostly employed in weaving stuffs, which find markets
in Albay and Camarines. We were accompanied from the Augustine convent
by a friar of Guimbal, who obviously exercised much influence over his
brethren and over the whole community. His conversation was both
entertaining and instructive. He had a good stud of horses, a handsome
carriage, and he certainly employs his large revenues with generous
hospitality. Not to repeat what has been repeated so often, the
Indians, on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365"
name="pb365">365</a>]</span>whole line of our journey, made a holiday
time for our reception, which partook everywhere of the character of a
public festivity. After the principalia had accompanied us to the
convents, and received their thanks from me, and their dismissal from
the Governor and the friar, a number of little girls were introduced,
to whom the service of the table and attendance on the guests were
confided. There was a strange mixture of curiosity, fear and respect in
their deportment; but they gathered round my arm-chair; their bright
black eyes looked inquiringly into my face, and asked for orders; while
one, who seemed rather a pet of the ghostly father, put her hand into
the curls of my white hair, which she seemed to consider worthy of some
admiration: but the friar told me they were discoursing among
themselves whether it was possible I could be a general and a great
man, who had no gold about my clothes; I was not dressed half as finely
as the officers they had been accustomed to see. They were very proud
of some of the pi&ntilde;a garments they wore, and one after another
came to display their finery. They took care to supply me with cigars,
and that light should be ready whenever the cigar was extinguished, and
when we sat down to our well-furnished repast, several of them were at
hand to remove the plates, to provide others, and to see that we were
well provided with the delicacies of the day. On our way back to
Iloilo, we learnt that the principalia of Molo were to escort us in
their carriages to our domicile; they were waiting for us in the main
road, so that we made together quite a procession. They had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>before invited Captain Vansittart and the
officers of the <i>Magicienne</i> to their ball, and many attended,
keeping up the dance to an early morning hour.</p>
<p>We left Iloilo the following day. The Governor and several of the
principal people, among whom was a large group of Augustine friars,
accompanied us with music to the ship. Three loud shouts of grateful
hurrah broke forth from our decks, cordially responded to by our
hosts&mdash;and so farewell! and all happiness to Iloilo.</p>
<p>I have sent to Sir William Hooker, for the museum of the Royal
Gardens at Kew, sixty specimens of woods grown in the northern and
western districts of the island of Panay and the province of Antique,
of which the most notable are&mdash;the <i>molave</i>, the most useful
and compact of the Philippine woods, and applied to all purposes of
building; <i>bancaluag</i>, for fine work; <i>du&ntilde;gon</i>, for
ship-building and edifices; <i>bago-arour</i>, building and
cabinet-work; <i>lumati</i>, a species of teak; <i>guisoc</i>, a
flexible wood for ships and houses; <i>ipil</i> has similar merits;
<i>naga</i>, resembling mahogany, used for furniture; <i>cansalod</i>,
planks for floors; <i>maguilomboy</i>, for the same purpose;
<i>duca</i>, <i>baslayan</i>, <i>oyacya</i>, for ship-building;
<i>tipolo</i>, for musical instruments; <i>lanipga</i>, a species of
cedar used for carving and sculpture; <i>bayog</i>, spars for masts and
yards; <i>bancal</i>, for internal roofs and carving;
<i>malaguibuyo</i>, for flooring; <i>ogjayan</i>, flexible for joints,
&amp;c.; <i>lanitan</i>, guitars, violins, &amp;c.; <i>janlaatan</i>,
furniture; <i>lauaan</i>, spars for shipping; <i>basa</i>, in large
blocks for building and shipping; <i>talagtag</i>, cabinet-work;
<i>nino</i>, the bark <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href=
"#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>used for dyeing both red and
yellow; <i>bacan</i>, spars; <i>panao</i>, a medicinal wood used for
sore eyes by the Indians; <i>banate</i>, a fine and solid box-wood,
used for billiard-maces, has been exported to Europe;
<i>bancolinao</i>, ebony; <i>casla</i> has a fruit resembling a French
bean, whose oil is used by the natives for their lamps; <i>jaras</i>,
for construction of houses. It will be observed that all these bear
their Indian names, which are generally applied to them by the
Spaniards.</p>
<p>As regards the commercial position and prospects of the whole of the
central and southern islands of the Philippine Archipelago, the most
satisfactory details which have reached me are those furnished in 1857
by the Vice-Consul of Iloilo, Mr. Loney, to the Consul of Manila, from
which I extract the following information.</p>
<p>That portion of the Philippines called the Bisayas may be generally
described as including the whole of the islands to the southward of
Luzon, though, strictly speaking, it is understood to comprehend only
those of Samar, Leyte, Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol (with their
dependencies, Tablas, Romblon, Sibuyan, &amp;c.), and four
provinces&mdash;Misamis, Caraga, Zamboanga, and Nueva
Guipuzcoa&mdash;of the important island of Mindanao, next to Luzon the
finest and largest of the archipelago.</p>
<p>The administration of the revenue of the Bisayas was formerly in
charge of a separate Government Intendency (<i lang="es">Gobierno
Intendencia de Bisayas</i>) established in the city of Cebu; but this
being abolished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368"
name="pb368">368</a>]</span>in 1849, all the provinces, as regards
revenue, are now equally under control of the Superintendencia at
Manila. While, however, the provinces and districts of Luzon (with the
exception of Cavite, La Isabela, Nueva Viscaya, El Abra, San Mateo, and
La Union) are presided over by civil functionaries (<i lang=
"es">alcaldes mayores</i>), those of the Bisayas are governed by
military officers (<i lang="es">gobernadores militares y politicos</i>)
of the rank of captain to that of colonel, assisted in most instances
by a lieutenant-governor, a civilian, and usually a lawyer, who takes
cognizance of all ordinary civil and criminal cases.</p>
<p>The Bisayan group is mostly inhabited by a race resembling, in all
essential characteristics, the Tag&aacute;log, and other Malayan races
of Luzon. Their language may be called a dialect of the Tag&aacute;log,
though rather harsher in sound, and neither so copious, so refined, nor
so subjected to grammatical rules, as this latter idiom. The Bisayan
has more Malay words than have the dialects spoken in Luzon. The
natives of these islands and those of Luzon imperfectly comprehend each
other, though their languages are evidently derived from the same
parent stock.</p>
<p>The Bisayas furnish a hardy, seafaring race; but, as a rule, the
general tendency to indolence, attributed to the Philippine
&ldquo;Indian,&rdquo; applies, in a perhaps greater degree, to the
inhabitants of the whole southern group, and constitutes at present, in
the absence of any available means of coercion, one of the principal
obstacles to a more rapid extension of agriculture by the introduction
of European capital. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369"
name="pb369">369</a>]</span></p>
<p>The christianized population of the Bisayas may be estimated as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The largest number of unsubjected tribes (principally Mahomedan)
inhabit Mindanao, the total population of which is generally asserted
to amount to nearly one million souls. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb370" href="#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span></p>
<p>The island of Panay, advantageously placed towards the centre of the
Bisayas group, is distant at its nearest point&mdash;that of Potol, in
lat. 11&deg; 48&acute; N., long. 122&deg; W. of Greenwich&mdash;180
miles in a right line from Manila. Its shape is nearly triangular, and
it has a circumference of about 300 miles. It is the fifth in size of
the Philippine Islands, coming in this respect after Luzon, which has a
circumference of 1,059 miles; Mindanao, 900; Paragua, 420; and Samar,
390; but, though smaller than the islands just named, it is, next to
Luzon, the most populous of the archipelago, if Mindanao, with the
doubtful population of independent tribes above-mentioned, be left out
of the question.</p>
<p>Panay is divided into the three provinces of Capiz, Antique, and
Iloilo, which together contain a population of about 665,000.</p>
<p>Capiz occupies the whole of the northern portion of the coast of
Panay, for a distance of seventy-seven miles.</p>
<p>Its limits towards the interior may be defined by a curved line,
commencing from a little to the eastward of Point Bulacan, passing by
the Pico de Arcangel, in the Siaur&aacute;gan Mountains, and continued
westward to Pandan, on the coast. Its chief town is Capiz, situated on
the river of the same name. Though broken towards the southern and
western portion by an irregular series of mountain chains, the greater
part of the territory of Capiz consists of extensive low-lying plains,
which produce rice in great abundance. It possesses a few good
harbours, particularly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href=
"#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>that of Batan; and Capiz itself,
situated at the confluence of the rivers Panay and Capiz, affords
secure anchorage. Its tribute-paying population is officially reported
to be 135,000 souls.</p>
<p>Antique takes up the western side of the island, to an extent of 84
miles&mdash;from Point Naso on the south to Pandan on the
north&mdash;is of triangular shape, and limited on the north by the
province of Capiz, on the south and east by that of Iloilo, and on the
west by the sea. Antique is very mountainous, and, being comparatively
thinly inhabited, does not at present produce much for export,
especially as the greater development of its resources is retarded by
the want of good harbours, of which it does not possess one along its
whole line of coast. At its chief town and port, San Jos&eacute; de
Buenavista, a breakwater is in process of construction, which, if
completed, will give a great impulse to the trade of the province, by
enabling vessels to load there at all seasons of the year. At San
Jos&eacute; foreign whaling and other vessels not unfrequently call for
water and fresh provisions. The number of its inhabitants, exclusive of
the <i lang="es">remontados</i> and <i>monteses</i>, who occupy the
mountainous districts, is computed to amount to 80,000 souls.</p>
<p>Iloilo extends over the south-eastern portion of the island, is also
of triangular form, bounded on the north by Capiz, on the west by
Antique, and on the south-east by the arm of the sea which separates it
from the island of Negros. This, the largest, richest and most peopled
of the three provinces, deserves more particular notice. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span></p>
<p>Iloilo, its chief town, and the residence of its governor, distant
254 miles in a direct line from Manila, and placed by Spanish
hydrographers in lat. 10&deg; 48&prime; W. of the meridian of San
Bernardino, is situated near the south-eastern extremity of the island,
close to the sea, on the border of the narrow channel formed by the
island of Guimar&aacute;s, which lies opposite to it at a distance of
two miles and a half from the Panay shore.</p>
<p>The town is built principally on low, marshy ground, subject to
tidal influence, partly fronting the sea, and partly along the left
bank of a creek, or inlet, which runs towards Jaro, and after
describing a semicircle again meets the sea near Molo. Although the
principal seaport and seat of the government of the province, its
population is not so large as that of many of the towns in its
vicinity. It does not at present exceed 7,500, while Jaro, Molo and
Oton, towns in its immediate neighbourhood, possess 33,000, 15,000 and
20,000 respectively. This comparative scarcity of inhabitants is
principally owing to the want of space for further extension on the
narrow tongue of land on which the town is chiefly built. This obstacle
to its further increase should in time cease to exist, as efficient
measures are being taken to draw the population more inland; among
others, the erection of a new government house and public offices at a
more central point; the contemplated removal of the present church to a
more advantageous and open site, beyond the tongue of land alluded to;
and the convergence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373"
name="pb373">373</a>]</span>at this place of new and more direct roads
(now in course of construction) leading to and from the adjacent
populous towns.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the drawback of limited space, the progress in size
and importance of the town has of late years been very marked, while
the European residents, who, in 1840, numbered only three, now, in
1857, amount to 31 in Iloilo, and 30 in the remaining towns of the
province. A considerable portion of this number arrived during the past
two years, and the effect of this increase of Europeans, though their
number is so small, is already visible in the construction of new
buildings, and projects for the erection of many others. The rise in
house property may be illustrated by the fact that the house in which
the vice-consulate is established&mdash;constructed of wood with a
palm-thatched roof&mdash;is subject to a rental of 33 dollars per
month, or about 80<i>l.</i> per annum. The value of land for building
lots has also augmented in proportion.</p>
<p>The population of the province is given officially as 511,066; but
there is reason to think it considerably exaggerated, and that 400,000,
or at most 450,000, would be nearer the real amount.</p>
<p>The harbour of Iloilo, though well protected and naturally good, is
not without inconveniences, capable, however, of being obviated with
little trouble, and, provided with one of the excellent charts lately
issued by the <i lang="es"><span class="corr" id="xd21e13956" title=
"Source: Comisian Hidrografica">Comisi&oacute;n
Hidrogr&aacute;fica</span></i> (and, if approaching from the north,
with a pilot), large vessels may enter with safety. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span></p>
<p>The island of Guimar&aacute;s, which is twenty-two miles long by
three in breadth, forms in front of Iloilo a sheltered passage, running
nearly north and south, of a width varying from two miles and a half to
six miles, with deep water and good anchorage. The entrance to this
passage from the south is a good deal narrowed by the Oton shoal
(<i lang="es">Bajo de Oton</i>), which stretches for a considerable
distance from the Panay shore, and contracts for about a mile in length
the available channel at this part to the breadth of about two miles.
This, however, will be no obstacle for large ships during the
south-west monsoon (especially when the channel is properly buoyed
off), the passage being perfectly clear as far as it extends; and with
a contrary north-east monsoon they can work or drag through with the
tide, keeping well over towards Guimaras, the coast of which is clear
with deep water close in, anchoring, if necessary, on the edge of the
shoal, which affords good holding-ground, and, being of soft sand, may
be safely approached. The whole of this coast, protected as it is by
Guimaras, the Panay shore, and, in a considerable degree, by the island
of Negros, offers secure anchorage in the north-east monsoon; and
situated on the south-west portion of Guimaras, the fine port of
Buluanga, or Sta. Ana, of easy access and capable of admitting vessels
of the largest tonnage, will afford shelter under almost any
circumstances. The approach to the opposite or northern entrance is
generally made by the coasting vessels through the chain of small
islands (Gigantes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375"
name="pb375">375</a>]</span>Pan de Azucar, Sic&oacute;gon, Apiton,
&amp;c.), called collectively the <i>Silanga</i>, which lie off the
north-east coast of Panay and afford an excellent refuge for a
considerable distance to the vessels engaged in the trade with Manila
and the southernmost Bisayas. But though there is good anchorage among
these islands, particularly at Pan de Azucar and Tag&uacute;, it would
be more prudent for vessels of large burden, in cases where there is no
practical acquaintance with the set of the tides and currents, to take
the outside channel between the Silanga and the island of Negros. After
passing the Calabazas rocks and Pepitas shoal and making the castle or
blockhouse of Banate (formerly erected, like many others along the
Philippine coasts, for defence against the pirates of the Sooloo Sea),
the route is due south until sighting a group of seven remarkable
rocks, called the &ldquo;Seven Sins,&rdquo; for which a direct course
should then be made, the lead being kept going to avoid the Iguana Bank
(which is well marked off on the charts referred to), and on getting
south of the Iloilo Fort vessels of a certain tonnage may enter the
creek, or, if too large, should bring up on the east side of the fort,
where they are protected from the wind and the strength of the tides.
The depth of water on the bar at the entrance to the creek is about
five fathoms at low water; but at a short distance farther inside the
water shoals to fifteen feet at low water, and then deepens again. The
rise and fall being six feet, a vessel of 300 tons, drawing, when
loaded, sixteen to eighteen feet, can <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>easily obtain egress
with a full cargo. A dredging machine employed to clear away the mud
which has been allowed to accumulate at the shallower parts near the
entrance, would enable ships of almost any burden to complete their
cargoes inside. The <i lang="es">Santa Justa</i>, a Spanish ship of 700
tons, loaded, in 1851, part of a cargo of tobacco inside the creek, and
finished her lading outside.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that, the banks of the creek being of soft
mud, there is little or no risk to be apprehended from grounding.
Proceeding about a mile and a half up the creek (which varies in
breadth from half a mile to three-quarters of a mile, and affords
complete protection from wind and sea), the coasting crafts bring up at
the jetties of their respective owners, and have the great advantage of
discharging and loading at the stores without the necessity of
employing boats.</p>
<p>Beyond this point, the creek stretches as far as Molo. Formerly the
coasting vessels used, when necessary, to go on to Molo, but the
drawbridge through which they had to pass having got out of repair, and
the present bridge (now in very bad condition) affording no means of
passage, they remain at Iloilo, to which place the Molo traders have
had to transfer their warehouses.</p>
<p>The export trade of Iloilo, hitherto confined to the port of Manila
and the adjacent islands, is at present chiefly carried on by four
Spanish firms resident at Iloilo and owners of the better class of
native craft sailing from this port; but to these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>are
to be added a considerable number of mestizos, or half-castes,
principally of Chinese descent, living at the neighbouring towns of
Molo and Jaro, several of whom are also owners of vessels, and employ
considerable sums in the trade.</p>
<p>The principal products exported are leaf tobacco, sugar, sapan-wood,
rice in the husk (or paddy); hemp and hides, besides other articles in
lesser quantity, including horns, beche-de-mer, mother-of-pearl shell,
beeswax, canes, &amp;c., and a considerable amount of native
manufactured goods. Leaf, or unmanufactured tobacco, is at present the
article of most importance, and the one which the Spanish traders have
found most lucrative. It is purchased by them from the small native
growers, and shipped to Manila for exclusive sale to the government, at
prices fixed by the factory appraisers, according to the size and
quality of the leaf. From Iloilo some 30,000 quintals were shipped last
year for Manila, and from Capiz 20,000, giving about 50,000 as the
exportable quantity of the leaf produced in Panay per annum.</p>
<p>The export of tobacco to Manila, until the year 1845, did not amount
in this province to more than 10,000 quintals per annum; but in that
year the agent of a Manila firm having raised the usual low prices
given by the Iloilo traders from 10 rials to an average of 20 to 21
rials for the three first qualities, the export, in 1847, had rapidly
reached 24,000 quintals.</p>
<p>The attention of the government being directed to its growing
importance, it was resolved to institute <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb378" href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>a system of
&ldquo;Coleccion,&rdquo; through the governor and a staff of
collectors, similar to those &ldquo;Collecciones&rdquo; that are
established at Cagayan, La Union, and Nueva Ecija. By this system, the
purchase for, and export to, Manila by private traders, though not
positively interdicted (as is the case in the provinces just named),
was so much prejudiced and interfered with by the unequal competition
with the government (to which the private buyers had ultimately to sell
what they shipped), that the total export from Iloilo fell during the
six years from 1848 to 1853 from 25,000 to 18,900 quintals. In this
latter year the coleccion was withdrawn. In 1853 a company formed at
Madrid was allowed the exclusive privilege of the manufacture and
export of cigars and leaf tobacco to foreign markets. A large and
expensive stone-built factory was erected near Iloilo, the manufacture
of cigars organized, and purchases of the leaf effected, and, latterly,
the company&rsquo;s operations were extended to the cultivation of the
plant in different parts of the province. A clause, however, in its
charter rendered it incumbent on the company to furnish the factories
at Manila, if required, with a considerable yearly amount both of leaf
tobacco and cigars, equal, if necessary, to the amount annually derived
in the province from other sources. As a consequence, the requirements
made for the Manila factories (purposely augmented, it is said, by the
hostility of the then Intendente de Hacienda to the company) were to
such an extent as virtually to deprive it of all power to act on its
own account; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>and, after an existence of nearly three years,
its embarrassments were such as to compel its extinction, with the loss
of a considerable portion of the capital originally sunk. Had the
authorities at Manila favoured its development, the result, though
necessarily cramped by the defective principle inherent in all
monopolies, might have been favourable, as, with the liberty to
manufacture for, and ship to, foreign markets, it could have afforded
to give good prices, and might have extended the culture of the tobacco
plant. It is a suggestive fact in connection with this subject that one
of the Europeans formerly in the employ of the company has since had
cigars manufactured for local consumption, which he has sold at 8
dollars per thousand, nearly, if not quite, equal in quality to the
&ldquo;Imperiales&rdquo; occasionally manufactured at the factory at
Manila at 25 dollars per thousand.</p>
<p>Since 1853, and coexistent with the company&rsquo;s operations, the
purchase and shipment of tobacco by private individuals have been
resumed on their original footing; and, while the amount so shipped has
steadily, though very gradually, increased, prices have maintained a
slight upward tendency. The maximum rates, however, which the local
traders can afford to pay the native growers are not high enough to
bring about a rapid extension of planting, or induce these latter to
give time and labour enough to improve the quality of a plant, the
proper culture of which requires special attention, and the application
of more capital and intelligence than they have it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>in
their power to bestow. The Iloilo shippers complain of the arbitrary
manner in which the classification of qualities is made at Manila, and
of the fact that, even after delivery of the tobacco at the government
stores, it is held entirely at their risk until examined, repacked and
ready for shipment to Spain. The qualities shipped at Iloilo are
classed as 1st (of which a very small quantity is produced under the
present system), 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th; and any rejected by the
examiners at Manila as under the 5th quality is retained and burnt,
though no allowance on such portion is made to the vendor. The rates
given by the factory for the above qualities are 7&middot;75,
6&middot;75, 5&middot;25, 4, and 3 dollars per quintal respectively.
The seedlings are planted out in January, and the greater part of the
crop comes forward in May and June. The soil of the greater part of the
Bisayas is favourable to the growth of tobacco. The island of Negros
formerly produced about 8,000 quintals, of very good quality, which the
Iloilo traders, through their agents, were in the habit of purchasing
from the independent tribes inhabiting the interior; but the measures
taken by the present governor to bring the latter into subjection
having resulted last year in the slaughter of several hundreds and the
dispersion of the rest, supplies from this source are at present
stopped. Ceb&uacute; produces about 15,000 quintals, of rather inferior
quality. At Leyte, particularly in the district of Moasin, tobacco of
very excellent quality and colour is grown, but it does not pay to
produce in large quantity for export to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb381" href="#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>Manila, and is
consequently used almost exclusively in the Bisayas, where it is much
appreciated. Samar also grows tobacco for local consumption. The
manufacture of cigars is allowed throughout the Bisayas, but not for
sale at Manila or elsewhere.</p>
<p>For the present the export of tobacco from Panay and the other
islands possesses little direct interest for British or foreign
merchants, the transactions with government, as at present conducted,
not being of a satisfactory nature. It is, however, almost superfluous
to say, that if the existing government monopoly of tobacco were
abolished (substituted by a system of farming out lands, a direct
territorial tax on the quantity under cultivation, or a duty on
exports), and both the free manufacture for, and direct shipment to, a
foreign market allowed, the export from Panay would immediately become
of great importance to the foreign trade. The soil of a very great
portion of the island being well adapted for the cultivation of the
plant, the export, under the stimulus of much higher prices and the
consequent employment of more and better-directed capital, would be
capable of great expansion, particularly if, as would in all
probability be the case, the culture were undertaken by Europeans, and
the present system of small patches cultivated by natives gave place to
estates on a large scale, as in Cuba. The benefits which would accrue
to the native population by the opening up of larger sources of
industry need not be pointed out. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382"
href="#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span></p>
<p>The subject of the suppression of the existing monopoly is a most
important one for the Philippines; and it is to be hoped that the
government at Madrid, encouraged by the beneficial results of the
abrogation, in 1819, of the monopoly in Cuba, will at no distant date
resolve to overcome the difficulties which at present surround the
question, particularly as its solution becomes yearly more urgent, and
more called for on the part of both Europeans and natives.</p>
<p>Sugar, as an article of export, may be said to be as yet
comparatively in the germ. By an abstract taken from notes of province
cargoes given daily by the <i lang="es">Boletin Oficial</i> of Manila,
it is seen that nearly 12,000 peculs went forward last year from this
province to Manila, of which it may be estimated that about 3,000 were
brought over from the Isla de Negros, and sent on to the capital as
Iloilo sugar. So great has been the stimulus given by the high prices
for this article which have lately ruled, that the quantity exported
from Iloilo alone will not fall short of 20,000, or say, with
contributions from Negros, about 25,000 peculs, or nearly 1,600 tons;
and, were the present rapid extension of planting to continue in the
same ratio for three years, the amount exportable would in that time,
as there is no want of available land, reach about 80,000 peculs, or
5,000 tons, subject to further augmentation from other sources, should
foreign vessels commence loading at this port.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14010src" href="#xd21e14010" name="xd21e14010src">3</a> At the
island of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>Negros, from whence the voyage occupies from six
to ten hours, the soil of which is eminently fertile, and which
possesses immense tracts particularly adapted for the growth of sugar,
a similar extension of culture is in progress, in spite of the great
drawback of the comparative sparseness of its population, which alone
prevents it from yielding sugar and hemp in larger proportion than any
other province in the Philippines. At present Negros produces about
14,000 peculs, or nearly 900 tons, of sugar, of which more than
two-thirds go to Manila direct, and the remainder by way of Iloilo.
There is a further available source from whence sugar (in the event of
foreign vessels loading at Iloilo) would be derivable at the contiguous
island of Ceb&uacute;, which produces upwards of 90,000 peculs, or
5,695 tons, for the Manila market, and is within easy distance of two
to three days&rsquo; sail from Iloilo.</p>
<p>The effective nature of the stimulus given by the present prices
will be comprehended when it is considered that the value of Iloilo
sugar, which in previous years up to 1855 had generally ranged from 2
to 2&middot;10 dollars per pecul in the Manila market, is now
5&middot;68&frac34; dollars per pecul at Manila, against 3&middot;2 to
3&middot;3 dollars, with 25 per cent. for prem. on silver, or equal to
4&middot;06 dollars to 4&middot;21&frac12; dollars here, and as long as
the rate obtainable at Manila does not recede below 3 dollars per pecul
of 140 lbs., the extension of planting will be continued. Of late
years, owing to the disproportionally low prices paid at Manila, sugar
planting had in many districts been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>abandoned as
unremunerative, but during the past and present year it has rapidly
increased, particularly since the introduction of a more economical
kind of furnace, in which the refuse cane is used to some extent in
place of the large amount of wood formerly consumed.</p>
<p>The very defective nature of the process employed by the native and
mestizo planters does not allow of the production in Iloilo of a
superior class of sugar, and all that leaves for Manila may be
described as &ldquo;ordinary unclayed;&rdquo; but the grain is usually
very good, and on undergoing the ulterior processes in England and
Australia, it yields a fine strong sugar, and has been much approved of
for boiling purposes at the Glasgow refineries. Were a better system of
crushing and boiling introduced here, sugar of an excellent quality
would be produced, and it is greatly to be desired that a few Europeans
with sufficient capital and experience would form estates in this
neighbourhood. At present there is not a single iron-mill in the
island. The unclayed sugars of the Philippines in ordinary times, even
under the present defective and consequently expensive mode of
production are held to be the cheapest in the world. The only Europeans
now engaged in the cultivation of sugar in this quarter are a French
planter, at Negros, who produces an excellent sugar (which always
commands upwards of 1 dollar a pecul more than ordinary Iloilo), and a
planter of the same nation, in this province, who has lately commenced
on a limited scale. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385"
name="pb385">385</a>]</span></p>
<p>Taking the prices quoted above as a basis (4&middot;21&frac12;
dollars here against 5&middot;68&frac34; dollars at Manila), the
difference in favour of this, the place of production, is now
1&middot;47&frac14; dollar per pecul; but supposing the additional
47&frac14; cents to be given here by the foreign exporter in order to
secure such share of the crop as would be required to load a direct
vessel, there would still remain an important saving of 1 dollar per
pecul, or say 17&frac12; per cent. less than the prime cost at Manila.
The freight to Manila at present charged by the coasting vessels is 50
cents per pecul. The bulk of the sugar crop is delivered from February
to March.</p>
<p>Sapan-wood is exported in considerable quantity from the province of
Iloilo. It is chiefly produced in the vicinity of the southern coasting
towns, Guimbal, Miagao, and San Joaquin (the farthest within twenty
miles of Iloilo), from whence the greater part is brought round by sea
to Iloilo for exportation to Manila, and the rest shipped direct from
Guimbal. Last year, as reported in the imperfect notes of the <i lang=
"es">Boletin Oficial</i>, 32,723 peculs, or 2,045 tons, were shipped to
Manila, and 789 peculs from Antique.</p>
<p>The high prices lately obtained at Manila have led to the formation
of new plantations, which will still further increase the exportable
amount. A large quantity is sent on yearly to Singapore and Amoy, and
forms the bulk of the cargoes of such vessels as load at Manila for the
former port.</p>
<p>The quality of the Iloilo sapan-wood would be much better were the
natives to abstain from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href=
"#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>practice of cutting down a large
portion before the trees are sufficiently grown. When allowed to obtain
its proper development, it is said to be quite equal or superior to
that of Misamis or Bolinao, at present the best qualities brought to
the Manila market. As both sellers and brokers endeavour to deliver the
wood as soon as possible after it is cut, the loss in weight on the
voyage to Manila is said to be sometimes as much as 12 to 14 per cent.
The present price of sapan-wood delivered at Iloilo is, with the
addition of 25 per cent. for cost of silver, 1&middot;08 dollar per
pecul against the Manila rate of 1&middot;75 to 1&middot;875 dollar,
leaving a considerable margin in favour of vessels loading here for a
foreign market. The freight to Manila is 31&middot;25 cents per
pecul.</p>
<p>Hemp (so called, though in reality the product of a variety of the
plantain) produced in Iloilo is chiefly of a long, white fibre, equal
to what is known in the London market as &ldquo;Lupiz,&rdquo; used in
the manufacture of the native fabrics, and at present little attention
is paid to it as an article of export. But though Iloilo produces
little or no surplus hemp, the small coasting craft annually bring here
some 350 tons from the neighbouring islands and provinces of Leyte,
Samar, Negros, Camarines, and Albay, received at those places in
exchange for the paddy and native goods of this province.</p>
<p>Both Leyte and Samar now produce large quantities of excellent hemp
for the Manila market, particularly the former island; and the voyage
hither throughout the greater part of the year is so short <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>(at
present vessels take five to six days in going and two to return) that
were the native traders to find a ready market at Iloilo, at prices
relatively equivalent to those of Manila, it is more than probable that
a considerable additional quantity would be directed to Iloilo instead
of to the capital.</p>
<p>At the island of Negros the production is increasing very rapidly, a
large quantity having been planted during the past year, several
pueblos and districts possessing tracts of upwards of 100,000 and
200,000 plants, which will come into use during the next two years, and
as the plant is remarkable for its great propagative power, the
obtainable quantity should increase in duplicative ratio every year.
The export of hemp from the Isla de Negros amounts at present to 13,000
to 14,000 peculs, or about 850 tons, per annum, chiefly from the port
of Dumaguele, on the eastern side of the island.</p>
<p>When it is recollected that in 1831 the whole export of hemp from
the Philippines did not amount to more than 346 tons, and that in 1837
it had already reached 3,585 tons, and that during 1856 no less than
22,000 tons left Manila for the United States and Europe, some idea may
be formed of the future of this valuable article at the fertile island
of Negros, even with the drawback already alluded to of a scanty
population.</p>
<p>I am the more inclined to dwell on the facts regarding Negros, as
from its close proximity it may almost be considered, in the event of
direct exports from Iloilo, as an integral part of the island of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>Panay. The amount of hemp shipped from Capiz
last year was 6,458 peculs, or 400 tons, chiefly, however, of an
inferior description made from the fibres of the <i>p&aacute;cul</i>, a
wild variety of the plantain. As this inferior hemp, however, commands
a remunerative price, I believe the plant producing the genuine article
is now being more generally cultivated at Capiz. The rate for hemp here
may be quoted at 5&middot;375 dollars, or, with 25 per cent. for cost
of silver, 6&middot;715 dollars per pecul, against the Manila rate of
7&middot;75 to 8 dollars. Freight to Manila, 50 cents per pecul.</p>
<p>Rice in the husk, or Paddy, is an important item in the agriculture
of Panay, though at present of little actual interest in relation to
the foreign trade. The yearly production of the province of Iloilo,
though nothing definite is ascertained regarding it, may be supposed to
be 850,000 cavans, of which probably 40,000 are exported to the
neighbouring islands and Manila. Capiz may produce about 900,000
cavans, and export about 100,000 in the same way. Antique also
contributes a considerable quantity for the consumption of the island,
and exports upwards of 15,000 cavans. These amounts, however, must be
looked upon as guesses at the actual quantities consumed and
shipped.</p>
<p>The paddy exported is chiefly conveyed in small schooners
(<i>pancos</i> and <i>barotos</i>) to the neighbouring islands of Leyte
and Samar, and also to Camarines and Albay, in exchange for hemp and
cocoa-nut oil (the latter obtained at Leyte), which are either
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span>brought to Iloilo for sale or taken on to
Manila. When prices at Manila leave a sufficient margin (which they
generally do throughout the year), some amount of paddy goes in that
direction, forming a portion of the cargo of the vessels leaving for
the capital.</p>
<p>The paddy shipped from Iloilo is chiefly drawn from the vast plains
of Dumangas, Zarraga, Pototan, Santa Barbara and Barotac-viejo. Were a
large portion of land brought under cultivation, the increased surplus
of this grain would be available for an export to China, in which
foreign vessels might be employed, as they frequently are at Sual, in
Pangasinan; and it may not unreasonably be surmised that, in the course
of time, ships frequenting the port of Iloilo, and proceeding to China,
will naturally take part of their cargoes in rice, and thus give a
further impetus to its cultivation. At present, owing to the late
scarcity of rice in Camarines and Leyte, the price of paddy at Iloilo
has risen to 10 rials per province cavan, which is equal to one and a
half of the measure (<i lang="es">cavan del rey</i>) used at Manila.
The other articles shipped from Panay likely to be of importance to the
direct export trade are:&mdash;</p>
<p>Hides&mdash;Buffalo and cow, of which the last year&rsquo;s exports
to Manila were 128 tons from Iloilo, 60 tons from Capiz, and 24 tons
from Antique. Prices here (very high at present) may be quoted at 5
dollars to 8 dollars for buffalo, and 10 dollars to 14 dollars for cow
hides, per pecul. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390"
name="pb390">390</a>]</span></p>
<p>Horns&mdash;A limited quantity from the three provinces. Price, from
2 dollars to 3 dollars per pecul.</p>
<p>Cowries&mdash;430 cavans were shipped last year from Capiz, 42 from
Antique, 33 from Iloilo. This article, formerly worth at Manila
2&middot;50 dollars to 3 dollars per cavan, has lately risen to 15
dollars.</p>
<p>Gum Mastick&mdash;2,359 peculs, or 147 tons, were sent last year
from Capiz to Manila, where its value is usually from 1&middot;50
dollar to 3 dollars per pecul.</p>
<p>Mother-of-Pearl Shell&mdash;A small quantity is obtainable at this
port, and at Capiz, chiefly brought from Sooloo, <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Zamboanga, and from the adjacent islands of the Silanga. Quotation here
usually about 18 dollars to 22 dollars per pecul.</p>
<p>Rattans or Canes&mdash;Used in packing produce at Manila; 401,000
went forward from Capiz in 1856, 104,000 from Iloilo, and 97,000 from
Antique.</p>
<p>Mat Bags&mdash;Made from the leaf of the sago palm, used also for
packing; 155,850 were shipped to Manila, from Capiz, in 1856.</p>
<p>Beeswax&mdash;A few peculs are annually shipped from the three
provinces to Manila.</p>
<p>Gutta-Percha&mdash;Some quantity of this valuable substance has been
sent from hence to Manila, but, either owing to adulteration, or
ignorance of the proper mode of preparation, it has not obtained an
encouraging price. The tree yielding it, called by the Bisayans
<i>nato</i>, abounds in this province, and in Guimar&aacute;s, and if
it prove to be the real <i>Isonandra gutta</i> of the Straits and
Borneo, should hereafter become of considerable importance. The
monopoly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>of shipment from Manila, granted to Se&ntilde;or
Elio, has an injurious effect on the production of this article.</p>
<p>Timber&mdash;for building, and woods, of various descriptions, for
furniture, abound in Panay, and the islands of the Silanga and
Guimar&aacute;s are peculiarly rich in valuable trees. From thence are
obtained the supplies for Iloilo and the neighbouring towns, and for
the construction of vessels, occasionally built at Guimar&aacute;s,
where one of 350 tons is now (1857) on the stocks; but as yet little
impression has been made on the immense quantity to be obtained.</p>
<p>Of other articles, which are either not adapted for European
markets, or as yet produced in insignificant quantities, I will merely
enumerate&mdash;cocoa, of excellent quality; arrowroot; vegetable
pitch, of which a considerable quantity is sent to Manila; wheat, which
grows freely in the elevated districts of the island, and of which
1,125 bags were sent from Iloilo and Antique in 1856; maize,
beche-de-mer, dried vegetables (beans, &amp;c., a large amount), sago,
cotton, tortoise-shell, deer-skins, ginger and gold-dust.</p>
<p>Gums, dyes and drugs, of various descriptions, abound in Panay, and
a scientific examination of the many products of this nature, of which
little or no use is made, is a great desideratum. It should be borne in
mind that most of the minor articles above-mentioned are also produced
by the neighbouring islands, and may be therefore obtainable in
increased quantities, should the anticipation of Iloilo becoming in a
great measure the emporium of the trade of the Bisayas be realized in
future. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of the mineral wealth of the island little or nothing definite is
known. Gold is found in the bed of a river near Abac&aacute;, in this
province, and near Dum&aacute;rao, in Capiz. Iron and quicksilver are
said to have been discovered, the former at various places in the
island; and coal is reported to exist in Antique; but these are points
which have hitherto received little attention. In a journey to the
interior, made with the governor of Iloilo, through the Silanga, along
the whole north-eastern portion of the province, and as for as the
Capiz boundary, near Dum&aacute;rao, Mr. Loney was shown several
specimens of ore, apparently containing a large percentage of iron.
With reference to this expedition, Mr. Loney adds from personal
experience, his testimony in confirmation of the accounts of the
fertility of the island, and the prosperous commercial future which
seems to await it. The roads in general are tolerably good until the
setting in of the heavy rains from August to October; but there is at
present in many cases a want of efficient bridges, which impedes the
free transit of produce towards the coast. The island does not afford a
superficies large enough for the formation of any considerable streams,
and the principal and only important river in this province, the
Jalaur, which meets the sea near Dum&aacute;ngas, and by which a large
quantity of paddy is conveyed to the coast, and forwarded to Iloilo, is
only capable in the dry season of bearing craft of very small
burden.</p>
<p>The system of purchases of produce at Iloilo is, as usual in nearly
all the provinces, to employ brokers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb393" href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>or <i lang=
"es">personeros</i>, who buy the produce from the native and mestizo
growers and dealers at the different pueblos in the interior and along
the coast, and receive a commission of five per cent. on the amount
delivered. It is generally necessary to make advances through these
brokers against the incoming crop, in order to secure any quantity, and
such payments in advance are always attended with a certain amount of
risk. The price of the article to be received is commonly fixed at the
time of paying over the advance, and for any overplus of produce
received from the grower the current rate at the time of delivery is
generally accepted. In the event of a permanent direct trade being
established, it is likely that the practice will in time become more
assimilated to that which obtains at Manila, <i>i. e.</i>, shippers may
be able to purchase or contract on the spot from mestizo, Chinese or
Spanish holders of produce, either directly or at the expense of a
trifling brokerage.</p>
<p>Nearly all payments being made to the natives in silver&mdash;as
they will seldom agree to receive gold&mdash;it is necessary to place
funds here in the former coin.</p>
<p>Besides the natural products above mentioned, Panay produces a large
quantity of manufactured goods, both for export and home consumption.
Of these the greater and more valuable portions, included under the
native term <i>sinamay</i>, are made of the delicate fibres of the leaf
of the pine-apple (<i>pi&ntilde;a</i>), either pure or mixed with silk
imported from China, and a proportion of the finer sorts of British
manufactured cotton thread. The process <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb394" href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>of separating the
pi&ntilde;a fibres and sorting them in hanks previous to manufacture,
and the manufacture itself, requiring a great deal of time and care,
the pure pi&ntilde;a textures are proportionally dear. Some of the
finest sorts are of exquisitely delicate texture. Those mixed with
silk, though not so durable, are cheaper, and have of late years been
gradually superseding the pure pi&ntilde;a fabrics, although these
latter are still much worn by the more wealthy natives and mestizos. To
such an extent, indeed, is silk from China now imported into this
province, that, according to the statement of the principal Chinese
trader in this article at Manila, fully 400,000 dollars worth is
annually sent to Iloilo from the capital. Latterly the price of silk
has risen from 40 to 45 dollars per chinanta of ten catties to 80 and
90 dollars, or say from 450 to 900 dollars per pecul.</p>
<p>The greater part of the pi&ntilde;a and mixed pi&ntilde;a, silk and
cotton fabrics is used for shirts for the men, and short jackets or
shirts for the women. The price varies considerably, according to the
fineness or coarseness of the texture, and the greater or less amount
of mixture, some pieces for the men&rsquo;s shirts costing as much as 7
dollars (the value of which, elaborately embroidered at Manila, is
sometimes enhanced to 50 or 100 dollars), and the inferior sorts 50
cents to 2 dollars per piece of 4&frac12; varas. The figured work of
these fabrics is generally of European cotton sewing thread or coloured
German and British yarn, and the stripes of thread, yarn or coloured
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>white silk. Textures of a cheaper character are
also extensively made of hemp and other fibres, costing two to four
rials each. There is also an extensive manufacture of coloured silk and
cotton goods for &ldquo;sarongs&rdquo; (similar to those, principally
of Bugis manufacture, used throughout the Malayan Archipelago),
cambayas, and silk and cotton kerchiefs for the head. The better class
of silk fabrics are excellent both for solidity of texture and finish.
Those of cotton are principally made of German and British dyed twist,
and of native yarn manufactured from cotton grown in several districts
in this province, and also imported from Luzon. The finer sorts are
well and closely woven, and the ordinary kinds of a cheap description
adapted for more common use. Trouserings, of cotton and mixed silk and
cotton, are manufactured to some extent, but the Manchester and Glasgow
printed drills and plain grandrills are fast displacing them as
articles of general consumption. Among the other manufactures may be
enumerated table-cloths, napkins, towels, coverlets, cotton rugs,
&amp;c. Of embroidery work, which enters so largely into the industry
of the provinces of Bulacan and Manila, there is little done in Iloilo,
with the exception of the working of sprigs of flowers on the lace and
network mantillas, which are much used by the female population in
attendance at church.</p>
<p>In addition to the goods above mentioned, a considerable amount of
coarse fabrics is made of the leaf of the sago palm, of hemp, and of
other fibres. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>These are known in the Manila market as
<i>Saguran</i>, <i>Guin&aacute;ras</i> and <i>Medrinaque</i>, and are
shipped to the United States and Spain, and in lesser quantity to
England. Saguran and guin&aacute;ras are largely used at the government
factories in packing the leaf tobacco forwarded to Spain. Price, from
25 to 37&frac12; dollars per pecul of 7&frac12; to 8 varas. Medrinaque
has for some years past been exported in increasing quantity to the
United States and Europe, where it is chiefly used for stiffening
dresses, linings, &amp;c. This article is principally made at Samar,
Leyte and Ceb&uacute;, from whence, in case of direct export, it will
be obtainable for shipment. Present prices in the Manila market for
Ceb&uacute; 20 dollars, Samar 18 dollars, per fifty pieces.</p>
<p>Considering that the Philippines are essentially an agricultural
rather than a manufacturing region, the textile productions of Iloilo
may be said to have reached a remarkable degree of development. Nothing
strikes the attention at the weekly fairs held at the different towns
more than the abundance of native goods offered for sale; and the
number of looms at work in most of the towns and villages also affords
matter for surprise. Almost every family possesses one of these
primitive-looking machines, with a single apparatus formed of pieces of
bamboo, and, in the majority of the houses of the mestizos and the
well-to-do Indians, from six to a dozen looms are kept at work. The
total number in this province has been computed at 60,000; and though
these figures may rather over-represent the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>actual quantity, they cannot be much beyond it.
All the weaving is done by women, whose wages usually amount to from 1
to 1&middot;50 dollar per month. In general&mdash;a practice
unfortunately too prevalent among the natives in every branch of
labour&mdash;these wages are received for many months in advance, and
the operatives frequently spend years (become, in fact, virtually
slaves for a long period) before paying off an originally trifling
debt. There are other workwomen employed at intervals to &ldquo;set
up&rdquo; the pattern in the loom, who are able to earn from 1 to
1&middot;50 dollar per day in this manner. It should be added that
Capiz and Antique also produce, in a lesser degree than Iloilo, a
proportion of manufactured goods.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the increasing introduction of European piece goods
into Panay, it is gratifying to observe that the quantity of mixed
pi&ntilde;a stuffs exported rather augments than otherwise with the
gradual addition to the general population and the increased means
derived by it from the rapidly progressive development of the resources
of the islands. Judging from the values of the quantities taken on in
almost every vessel leaving for the port of Manila, the annual export
in that direction would not seem to be at all over-estimated if put
down at 400,000 dollars. The goods represented by this amount are not,
it should be remarked, used in the city and province of Manila alone,
but enter also into the consumption of Pampanga, La Laguna, Camarines
and other provinces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398"
name="pb398">398</a>]</span>of Luzon. In addition to the export of
pi&ntilde;a to the capital, about 30,000 dollars worth of cotton and
silk sarongs and handkerchiefs are sent yearly to Camarines. Some
quantity is also exported to Leyte and Samar, but anything like an
approximate value of the goods so shipped cannot be given. In fact the
subject of statistics here has received so little attention, either
from the authorities or from the local traders themselves, that on
terminating his notice of the principal articles exported from Panay,
Mr. Loney regrets to find himself unable to supply a reliable account
of their united value. The <i lang="es">Estadistica de Filipinas</i>,
issued in 1855, and compiled at Manila by the <i lang="es">Comision
Central</i>, nominated for that purpose, gives, from data probably
obtained from the very imperfect custom-house entries, the following as
the value of the imports into Manila from Panay in 1854:&mdash;</p>

<p>To which sum if the exports to other islands and provinces be added,
it may be fairly inferred that the total value of exports from Iloilo
cannot fall short of 800,000 dollars; an amount which does not seem at
all out of proportion to the number of its inhabitants. These figures,
if Capiz be put down at 700,000 dollars, and the Antique exports be
taken at 70,000 dollars, will give to the yearly exports from Panay an
aggregate value of upwards of 1,500,000 dollars.</p>

<p>Or an augmentation in 1854 of considerably more than double the
amount given in 1852. While on this subject, it may be added that the
local custom-house has unfortunately registered no complete details of
the exports for 1856, though it has commenced doing so for 1857. These
details are, however, relatively of much less importance than those of
direct foreign shipments, which will demand future attention.</p>
<p>Mr. Loney thus adverts to the present state of the Iloilo import
trade:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although perhaps the greater part of the clothing for the
population of Panay is furnished by the native looms, still a large
amount of European goods is annually imported from Manila. I estimate
that on the average (as far as can be judged where anything like
positive data are totally wanting) about 30,000 dollars to 40,000
dollars per month are now brought in goods to the port of Iloilo by the
mestizo and Chinese traders, and subsequently disposed of at the larger
markets of Jaro, Molo, Oton, Mandurriao, &amp;c., from whence a certain
portion finds its way into the interior. This branch of the trade is as
yet principally conducted by the mestizo dealers of Molo and Jaro, who,
on completing their purchases of native-made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>goods for the Manila market, embark with them
(in numbers of from six to ten, fifteen, and sometimes twenty) in the
coasting vessels leaving for the capital. The returns for these
speculations they generally bring back in foreign (principally British)
manufactures, purchased at cheap rates from the large Chinese
shopkeepers at Manila. The sale of these goods by retail here is still
conducted in the rather primitive way of conveying them from place to
place on certain fixed days. In this way goods that appear to-day at
the weekly fair or market of Jaro, are subsequently offered for sale at
Molo, Mandurriao, Oton, or Ar&eacute;valo. They are carried to and from
the different pueblos in cumbrous, solid-wheeled vehicles, drawn by
buffaloes and oxen, a mode of conveyance which, during the wet season,
is attended with a good deal of delay and risk. The Chinese dealers at
Molo, and a few small traders at Iloilo, have, however, commenced
opening permanent shops, and it is probable that the number of these
will gradually increase throughout the province, though, as the fairs
are also the central point of attraction for all the products within a
certain radius of each pueblo, and thus bring together a large
concourse of people, the weekly transfer of piece and other goods from
one place to another must still continue to a great extent. There are
about thirty Chinese permanently established at Molo (mostly connected
with others at Manila, <span class="corr" id="xd21e14466" title=
"Source: eithers">either</span> as partners or agents), and two or
three at Jaro. A certain number are also employed in voyaging to and
from Manila with goods, after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402"
href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>realizing which here they
return for a fresh parcel, either taking the returns in money or
produce. One of the Chinese traders at Molo, who is well supplied from
the capital, sells goods to the amount of some 30,000 dollars or 40,000
dollars a-year. Owing, however, to too much competition among
themselves and the other traders, I do not, judging from the prices at
which they usually sell, think that their profits are in general at all
large. The fact that the mestizo dealers look for their principal
profit to the pi&ntilde;a goods which they take to Manila, and are
comparatively less solicitous to obtain an advance on their return
goods, has also a tendency to keep prices low, as compared with Manila
rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As is the case in most of the provinces where the Chinese
have penetrated, there exists a more or less subdued feeling of
hostility towards them on the part of the natives, and a tendency, both
among the mestizos and Spanish, to regard them as interlopers. But
though the government at Manila has been repeatedly urged to withdraw
them from the provinces, and confine their trading operations to Manila
alone, it does not seem inclined to adopt a measure which would prove
injurious to the general trade of the colony. It is true that if a
portion of the Chinese were induced to become agriculturists (for which
purpose alone they were originally admitted to the provinces), great
benefit would accrue in the shape of an increased outturn of produce;
but as yet their numbers in the interior are too few to enable them to
cultivate the ground on a large scale, and in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>small isolated bodies they would not have
sufficient security from the ill-will of the natives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The principal articles of foreign manufacture imported into
this province are&mdash;handkerchiefs (printed) of bright attractive
colours, wove and printed trouserings, ginghams, fancy cambayas, plain
grandrills, white shirtings, gray shirtings and gray longcloths, gray
twills (29 inches, both American and English), bleached twills, lawns,
white jaco-nets, striped muslins, cotton sewing thread, cotton sarongs,
cotton twist, or yarn, and woollens (not in much demand). There is also
sale for hardware, glassware and earthenware, and for other minor
articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Import duties are leviable at Iloilo on a valuation either by
tariff, or according to the market rate at time of entry. They are the
same as those charged at Manila, viz.:&mdash;</p>

ships, with the following exceptions:&mdash;Hemp, 2 per cent. by
foreign, and 1&frac12; per cent. by Spanish ships; tortoise-shell,
mother-o&rsquo;-pearl shell, 1 per cent. by foreign, and 1 per cent. by
Spanish ships; rice, 4&frac12; per cent. by foreign, and 1&frac12; per
cent. by Spanish ships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No duties are charged on goods arriving or departing
coastwise by coasting vessels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Port dues.&mdash;No special charges are yet fixed for vessels
arriving at Iloilo, but they may be stated as about equivalent to those
levied at Manila, viz.:&mdash;On foreign vessels arriving and leaving
in ballast, 18&frac34; c. per ton; with cargo inwards or outwards,
34&frac34; c. per ton; with cargo both inward and outward, 37&frac12;
c. per ton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wages are moderate at Iloilo:&mdash;Labourers, 12&frac12; c.
to 18&frac34; c. per day; carpenters, 18&frac34; c. to 25 c. per day;
caulkers, 25 c. per day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fresh provisions are obtainable at cheap rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weights and measures in use for produce are&mdash;the
quintal, of 4 arrobas, or 100 lbs. Spanish, equal to 101&frac34; lbs.
English; pecul of 100 catties, or 140 lbs. English. The cavan of rice
(<i lang="es">cavan de provincia</i>) is equal to one and a half of the
Manila cavan, or <i lang="es">cavan del rey</i>; it weighs about 190
lbs. English, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405"
name="pb405">405</a>]</span>measures 8,997 cubic inches. The pesada, by
which sapan-wood is sold, weighs 13 arrobas 13 lbs., or nearly
2&frac12; peculs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The currency is nominally the same as in Manila, but silver
dollars have to be paid for nearly all purchases, gold being of
difficult circulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the preceding outline of the trade of this port, you
will gather that at present, with an annual export of about 1,600 tons
of sugar, upwards of 2,000 tons of sapan-wood, and 350 to 400 tons of
hemp, it is (considering the quantity which the foreign shippers would
be able to secure) capable of furnishing cargoes for two foreign
vessels of moderate tonnage; and next year, as regards sugar, which
will form the bulk of the cargoes of foreign vessels loading here, the
supply will probably be doubled. The more important question, however,
as regards the foreign trade of Iloilo, is not as to the actual
quantity of produce (still so very limited) which this island may
furnish, but whether the concentration of produce from the neighbouring
islands and provinces will in reality be brought about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A review of the facts regarding the southern Philippines
would seem to lead to a conclusion in the affirmative. With Leyte and
Samar giving a combined annual export of 4,000 tons of hemp,
Ceb&uacute; upwards of 5,000 tons of sugar, Negros a (rapidly
expanding) product of about 900 tons of sugar and 800 tons of hemp, and
without taking into account the possible supply of hemp which may be
drawn from South Camerines and from Albay (which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>produce by far the largest part of the existing
export of hemp from the Philippines, and are, during the north-east
monsoon, within a shorter distance of Iloilo than Manila), it seems in
no way hazardous to assume that, on relatively equal prices being
obtainable here, Iloilo will attract in the course of time a gradually
augmenting proportion of the products which now go on to Manila. It may
be further conjectured that Misamis (which yields a considerable
quantity of remarkably good hemp), Caraga, and the other provinces of
Mindanao, may also in time contribute their share to the products
obtainable at a port which their traders must pass on their way to
Manila, though the full development of the intercourse of the
neighbouring islands with Iloilo will greatly depend on the amount of
European imports with which this latter port should gradually be able
to supply its new customers. The opinion of the natives themselves,
though not to be taken as a guide, may still serve in some measure as
an index of what may be looked for. In talking on the subject to the
owners of the small craft whose cargoes of hemp have been brought to
Iloilo, they have frequently said, &lsquo;If foreign vessels come here
and give higher prices, much more hemp from Leyte and Camarines will
come to Iloilo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ceb&uacute; producing rice and manufactures for its own
consumption, there is at present little communication between it and
Iloilo; but it is encouraging to learn that one of the partners of the
most enterprising Spanish firm at this place intends proceeding both to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>Ceb&uacute; and Leyte, to establish, if
practicable, a commercial connection, with the ulterior view of getting
both sugar and hemp sent to this quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is also a favourable symptom that the trade of the
contiguous islands is more and more attracting the attention of some of
the foreign firms in Manila. The American houses (generally the first
in enterprises of this kind) have already, through Spanish intermedia,
established agencies at Negros, Leyte and Ceb&uacute;, for the purchase
of hemp and sugar, and it is stated from Manila, on apparently good
authority, that one of them has lately advanced a sum of 170,000
dollars for this purpose, the distribution of which should have a
stimulating effect on production, and thus give a collateral aid to the
future exports from Iloilo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering the great advantages which would accrue from the
establishment of lines of small merchant steamers between the islands,
the fact that the government have lately given orders to commence
working the extensive coal districts existing at Ceb&uacute; is not
without importance. The subject of steam communication for the
archipelago is attracting attention at Manila, and it is not improbable
that in a few years the islands will be connected in this way in a
manner which will greatly tend to their advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should have been previously mentioned that the voyage from
Iloilo to Manila during the north-easterly monsoon (from November to
March) usually occupies the better class of square-rigged vessels in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>the trade from ten to fifteen days, and from
four to six days on the return voyage. Owing to the protection afforded
by the group of islands forming the Silanga, and by other harbours on
the route, vessels do not (as is usually the case between the ports on
the northern part of the more exposed coast of Luzon and the capital)
lay up during the stormy months from September to November; and
communication, though less frequent during these months, is seldom
altogether suspended for any length of time with Manila. On the
average, a vessel leaves for the capital every eight to twelve
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I add a few further extracts from a report on the trade of 1858,
with which Mr. Loney has favoured me, and which strongly exhibits the
growing importance of Iloilo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The import trade, in direct connection with British and
foreign houses, has increased during the past year to a degree which
could not have been anticipated. Formerly it did not exceed 7,000
dollars in amount; but now, during a period of two years, it has
reached fully 140,000 dollars, and is likely to increase much more in
future as the capabilities of the market for taking off an important
quantity of manufactures become more fully known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to the existence of a stock of foreign articles at
Iloilo, obtainable by the native dealers as a general rule (and as a
consequence of the more direct manner in which they reach their hands)
at cheaper prices than from the Chinese shops at Manila, many of the
native, and even some of the Chinese traders, find <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>the
advantage of making their purchases on the spot instead of in Manila,
and some of the former have ceased altogether to undergo the expense
and loss of time they formerly incurred in proceeding to Manila to lay
in their stocks, while others make voyages to the capital less
frequently than before, and send on their pi&ntilde;a goods under the
care of friends or agents; consequently, the trade is beginning to be
conducted in a less primitive manner than in previous years, when each
small trader brought on his goods himself, purchased at high rates from
the Manila shopkeepers. Dealers from Antique, from the island of Negros
and from Leyte now also find at Iloilo a stock of goods sufficient to
supply their wants. Another beneficial effect is, that those who buy
wholesale at Iloilo are enabled to dispose of their goods to the small
dealers, or to their agents, who distribute them over the interior, at
lower prices than formerly. Goods are thus saleable, owing to this
greater cheapness, at places in the interior of the island, where they
were formerly rarely bought, and the natural consequence is, a
considerable increase of consumption. The concurrent testimony of all
the older residents in the province is, that during the last few years
a very marked change has taken place in the dress and general exterior
appearance of the inhabitants of the larger pueblos, owing in great
measure to the comparative facility with which they obtain articles
which were formerly either not imported, or the price of which placed
them beyond their reach. In the interior of the houses the same
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span>change is also observable in the furniture and
other arrangements, and the evident wish to add ornamental to the more
necessary articles of household uses; and those who are aware how
desirable it is, from the peculiarly apathetic nature of the natives,
to create in them an ambition for bettering the condition of themselves
and their families, or emulating that of others, by placing within
their reach the more attractive and useful articles of European
production, will at once recognize in these facts the beneficial
tendency of increased and cheaper imports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to duties derivable from imports, we must
consider the more or less remote probability of direct imports from
Europe or China to Iloilo. It needs very little acquaintance with the
gradual and hesitative processes of trade to be aware of the slowness
with which they adapt themselves to new channels of communication.
Especially is this the case in reference to these southern islands,
from the previous commercial seclusion in which they had been
kept&mdash;a seclusion so great that it may be safely asserted that the
island of Panay, with its 750,000 inhabitants, is scarcely known, by
name even, in any of the commercial marts of Europe, America, or even
of Asia. Consequently, it affords no ground for surprise that no direct
transactions in imports have taken place. It must be recollected that
the years 1857&ndash;58 have been eminently unfavourable for new
commercial enterprises of any kind, owing to the depressed state of
trade in all the markets of the world. This state of depression, though
still felt, is, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411"
name="pb411">411</a>]</span>however, drawing to a close, and the Iloilo
market, among others, will doubtless attract the attention of European
manufacturers and capitalists, though some time must necessarily elapse
before a sufficient number of shippers can be found to send
consignments of such a varied nature and assortment as would be
required to make up a cargo to suit the wants of Panay and the
neighbouring islands. Already consignments have arrived by way of
Manila, which were made up specially for the Iloilo market; and this
circumstance, and the fact that the Manchester manufacturers are
beginning to take an interest in the Iloilo demand, fully warrant the
belief that before long consignments from Europe, by the way of Manila,
will take place on an important scale, and pave the way to direct
shipments to Iloilo. Though it is almost useless to prognosticate in
cases of this kind, where so many circumstances may occur to retard or
accelerate the development of a new market, still I have no hesitation
in affirming it to be much more than probable, that in the course of
two years from this time Spanish vessels will arrive from Liverpool
direct, or touching and discharging part of their cargoes at Manila,
more particularly as by that time direct exports will have taken place,
and the sugar crop be raised to a point which will render it easy for
the vessels arriving with piece goods to obtain return cargoes of
sugar, sapan-wood and hides, all of which products, it is unnecessary
to say, can be obtained at Iloilo much more cheaply than in Manila.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is also probable that direct imports from China will take
place sooner than from Europe. The employment of raw Shanghai silk is
much greater at Iloilo than in any of the other Philippine provinces,
and the consumption amounts to fully 30 peculs per month, worth, on an
average, 600 dollars, silver, per pecul, or say 18,000 dollars per
month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The export trade from Iloilo direct to foreign markets is, in
fact, evidently the primary event on which the commercial fate, so to
speak, of the Bisaya Islands depends. The chief obstacle, in addition
to those mentioned above, which has retarded its commencement has been
the extreme smallness of the yield of sugar. In 1855&ndash;56, the
Iloilo crop, including some quantity received from the island of
Negros, scarcely reached 12,000 peculs, and, instead of increasing, it
had been declining in consequence of the discouraging effect of the
miserable price of 1&middot;875 to 2 dollars per pecul of 140 lbs.; all
that could be obtained for it after incurring the expense of sending it
to Manila. In 1856&ndash;57, under the stimulus of higher prices, the
yield amounted to 35,000 to 37,000 peculs. In 1857&ndash;58, these high
prices had a still more stimulating effect on the planting of cane, and
it was calculated that the crop would yield at least 50,000 peculs; but
an excess of rainy weather reduced the actual outturn to about 30,000.
The present crop, however, of 1858&ndash;59 has escaped the danger of
rain, and it is computed that it will yield about 80,000 peculs from
January to July next. Some estimates place it as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name="pb413">413</a>]</span>high
as 100,000 peculs, but in this I think there must be exaggeration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yield of sugar at Iloilo (leaving out of the question the
crop of Isla de Negros, which is now computed to produce 30,000 peculs,
and that of Antique, 20,000, both available for the Iloilo market)
having fortunately reached the above amount, direct sugar exports have
now become possible, and preparations are made for shipments to
Australia direct, during the first months of the ensuing year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To reach the consuming markets by the most direct
line, to avoid <span class="corr" id="xd21e14662" title=
"Source: transhipments">transshipments</span> and save double freights
are objects, commercially, of the highest importance.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14665src" href="#xd21e14665" name=
"xd21e14665src">4</a> And there is an aspect of the matter which
renders it still more necessary, as regards the Philippine trade, that
these objects should be kept in view. Australia is now, after Great
Britain, the most important market for the Philippine sugars, and
particularly for the reclayed Bisayan sugars of Iloilo and Ceb&uacute;,
which are there used for refining purposes, and it will most
undoubtedly be before long the largest consumer of the sugar of these
islands. In 1857 the exports of Iloilo and Ceb&uacute; sugar from
Manila to Australia were 18,178 and 51,519 peculs respectively, while
to all the other markets, including Great Britain, they were only
11,519 and 41,699 peculs; and the same year the total export of all
kinds of sugar to Australia was even more than to Great Britain, being
17,847 tons, or 285,552 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href=
"#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>peculs, to the former, against
16,675 tons, or 266,800 peculs, to the latter market. In the present
year (1858), the total export from Manila to Australia, owing to a
deficiency in the Pampanga crop, and the discouragement caused to the
Australian importers by the high prices of 1857, have only reached
9,038 tons, or 145,028 peculs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime Mauritius, Java and Bengal all supply large
and increasing quantities of sugar to Australia, and Mauritius in
particular, possessing the great advantages of greater proximity (as to
time) and of machinery and other appliances far superior to those in
use in the Philippines, furnishes the Australian market with a large
quantity of crystallized and yellow sugars, which are much sought for
in Sydney and Melbourne, where the steady increase of population and
general wealth augment the demand for high-classed sugars. In 1857 the
Australian colonies took 24,000 tons, or 384,000 peculs, of sugar from
Mauritius; and the latest accounts anticipate that the shipments this
year to the same quarter will be 30,000 tons, or 480,000 peculs. To
quote the words of the <i>Port Louis Commercial Gazette</i> of August
10th, 1858:&mdash;&lsquo;There is no doubt that the present crop will
reach the figures of 240,000,000 lbs., say 120,000 tons&rsquo; (nearly
2,000,000 peculs); &lsquo;but as the Australian colonies took 24,000 of
the last crop, we must expect they will take at least 30,000 of this,
our crystallized and yellow sugars gaining in estimation there.&rsquo;
The same journal, of the 27th of October, adds, &lsquo;This
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>facility of realizing produce at fair prices has
given animation to business and has improved the prospects of the
colony. There are now 150 vessels in our harbour, loading and
discharging for and from different parts of the world. Our marine
establishments are busily engaged in repairing vessels of different
nations that have been happy to seek refuge here; our vast quays are
too small for our commerce; the capacious new stores lately erected,
and which embellish our port, are filled with goods and produce; 25,000
immigrants have been added to our population this year, whilst only
6,500 have left. Our public revenue has largely
increased&mdash;companies are prosperous&mdash;cultivation has been
extended, sugar machinery and works improved and increased, and private
buildings throughout the principal part of the town enlarged and
improved in appearance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately for the Philippines, with respect to their
better-appointed rivals&mdash;Mauritius, Java and Bengal&mdash;the
low-graded unclayed sugars of Iloilo, Capiz and Antique, Isla de Negros
and Ceb&uacute;, are, in ordinary times, cheaper than those of either
of the latter colonies, and consequently more adapted for refining
purposes; but nothing can place in a stronger light than the above
facts regarding the export from Mauritius the very great importance of
<i>keeping the way open</i> for exporting the unclayed Philippine
sugars to Australia at the cheapest possible cost to the importers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The much greater extent and more than equal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>fertility of the Philippines, as compared with
Mauritius, must, in the end, if no artificial obstacles are again
imposed on the production of the former, lead to the development of
larger sugar crops than those of the latter colony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The results of the opening of the ports of Soerabaya,
Samarang, Cheribon, and others in the island of Java are encouraging
circumstances, as showing, among other similar examples, of what
importance Iloilo, as the central port of the Bisayan Islands, may
become. Soerabaya and Samarang (and especially the former), which enjoy
a favourable proximity to the chief points of production, now export an
immense quantity of produce, and orders for the direct shipment to
Europe of rice, sugar, coffee, tobacco and other Javan products are
transmitted by electric telegraph by the Batavian houses to their
agents at these ports over a distance exceeding 350 miles. I cannot at
present do more than briefly allude to the approaching commencement of
an export of timber and furniture woods from Iloilo and Antique to
China. The Spanish ship <i lang="es">Santa Justa</i> loaded a large
cargo of wood this year for Hong Kong, which has lately been sold at
63&frac12; cents per foot. Since then, in anticipation of the demand
for the rebuilding of Canton, the price has risen in Hong Kong, and
arrangements are being made for the charter of a large vessel, either
Spanish or foreign, to convey other cargoes to China; and there is
every prospect of there being, before long, an active traffic in this
article, which, as before noticed, is of excellent quality, abundant,
cheap, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>easily accessible near Iloilo, and at the
adjoining province of Antique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is recommended that vessels making the voyage to Iloilo
from Australia, or any place to the south of the Philippines, should,
during the S.W. monsoon, enter the archipelago between the islands of
Basilan and Zamboanga, and, on passing Point Batalampon, keep well up
to Point Gorda, and make the Murcielagos Island, so as to avoid being
driven to the westward by the strong currents setting from off the
Mindanao coast during both monsoons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pending the N.E. monsoon, the best course is to make a
<i>d&eacute;tour</i> to the east of the Philippines, and enter the
archipelago by the Straits of San Bernardino. The straits should be
entered by Samar and Masbate. Vessels bound from Manila or northern
ports may proceed through the Mindoro passage, but they should consult
Don Claudio Montero&rsquo;s charts. After passing Tablas and Romblon
(an excellent harbour there), make for the Silanga Islands, a good mark
for which is the high conical island called Sugar Loaf (Pan de Azucar).
During the N.E. monsoon vessels should keep between the islands of
Jintotolo and the larger Zapato (Shoe Island), but during the S.W. pass
between Oliuaya and the smaller Zapato. The best channel is between
Sicogon and Calaguan, but the outer and broader passage between the
groups of islands and that of Negros is preferable for large ships.
There is safe anchorage through the inner route. At Bacuan and Apiton
supplies are to be found. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href=
"#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The tide through the Silanga Islands and Seven Sins flows at
the rate of three to four miles an hour&mdash;from the Seven Sins to
Iloilo often at six to seven miles an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commercial prosperity is so intimately connected with general
improvement and the increase of human happiness, that one cannot but
look with interest upon the results of any legislation which removes
the trammels from trade and gives encouragement to industry, and the
island of Panay may be considered a promising field for the future. The
latest accounts report that the planting of cane has been extended very
rapidly in this province, owing to the continuance of high prices for
sugar, and also to the fact of the direct export trade to Australia
having commenced. Planters now see that the arrival of foreign vessels
will lead to a permanent demand for their sugars at prices which will
pay them better than those formerly obtainable for the Manila market,
from whence, before the opening of the port of Iloilo to foreign trade,
all the sugar of this and the neighbouring provinces had to be shipped
at a great additional expense in heavy coasting freight, landing and
reshipping charges, sea risk, commission, brokerage, &amp;c., all of
which are now avoided by direct shipment at the place of
production.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stimulus given to planting has resulted this year in an
increase in the yield to 60,000 peculs (3,750 tons), and, judging from
the amount of cane planted for next season&rsquo;s crop, it is fully
anticipated that in 1860 about 140,000 peculs (7,500 tons) will be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>produced, without counting on the quantity
yielded by the neighbouring provinces of Antique (30,000 peculs) and
the island of Negros (35,000 to 40,000 peculs), from both of which
places sugar is brought and exported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difference in the cost of sugar at Iloilo and at Manila
is at present 2<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> per ton, free on board;
as will be seen from the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The island of Panay, of which Iloilo is the chief port, is
divided into the three provinces of Iloilo, Capiz, and Antique, which
contain respectively 527,970, 143,713, and 77,639 inhabitants, or a
total of 749,322, according to the official returns of 1858.</p>
<p class="signed">&ldquo;British Vice-Consulate for Panay,<br>
&ldquo;<i>Iloilo, 2nd May, 1859.</i> &ldquo;<span class="sc">N.
Loney.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the favourable prospects for commerce at Iloilo,
little or nothing has been done for the improvement of the port or for
facilitating the extension of its trade. There is no buoy, no light, no
indication of dangerous places, though the Oton shoal is extending
itself, and it is of the greatest importance that the safe channel
should be pointed out to navigators. The latest Admiralty instructions
(1859) are as follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Port Iloilo, situated on the southern shore of Panay Island,
though well protected and naturally good, is not without certain
inconveniences, capable, however, of being easily obviated; provided
with a good chart, and if approaching from the northward with a pilot,
large vessels may enter with safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The depth of water on the bar at the entrance to the creek or
river Iloilo is about five fathoms at low water, but at a short
distance within it decreases to fifteen feet, and then deepens again.
The rise of tide <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421"
name="pb421">421</a>]</span>being six feet, a vessel drawing sixteen to
eighteen feet can easily enter or leave; and when, as is proposed, a
dredging-machine is employed to clear away the mud which has been
allowed to accumulate at the shallower parts near the entrance, vessels
of almost any burden will be able to complete their cargoes inside. A
Spanish ship of 700 tons, in 1857, loaded part of a cargo of tobacco
inside the creek, and finished the lading outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The banks of the creek being of soft mud, there is little or
no risk to be apprehended from grounding. Proceeding about a mile and a
half up the creek, which varies in breadth from one-half to
three-quarters of a mile, the coasting craft bring up at the jetties of
their respective owners, and have the great advantage of discharging
and loading at the stores without employing boats. Beyond this point
the creek reaches as far as Molo, to which place coasting vessels
formerly could proceed by passing through a drawbridge. This got out of
repair, and the present bridge affording no means of passage, they
remain at Iloilo, where the Molo traders have had to transfer their
storehouses. The works of a new moveable bridge, to allow vessels to
pass, have, however, already been commenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The island of Guimaras forms, in front of Iloilo, a sheltered
passage, running nearly north and south, of a breadth varying from two
miles and a half to six miles, with deep water and good anchorage. The
southern entrance to this passage is much narrowed by the Oton Bank,
which extends a considerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href=
"#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>distance from the Panay shore, and
contracts for about a mile the available channel at this port to the
breadth of about two miles. This shoal is fast becoming an island.
There is, however, no obstacle to large vessels during the north-west
monsoon (especially as the channel is to be buoyed), the passage being
quite clear, and in the north-east monsoon they can work or drop
through with the tide, keeping well over towards Guimaras (the coast of
which is clear, with deep waters quite close in), anchoring, if
necessary, on the edge of the shoal, which affords good holding-ground
and may be safely approached. The whole of this part of the coast is,
in fact, safe anchorage during the north-east monsoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If blowing hard in the southern channel to Iloilo, a vessel
may proceed to the port of Bulnagar, or Santa Ana, on the south-west
side of Guimaras, which is of easy access, and capable of admitting
vessels of the largest tonnage, and it affords good shelter under
almost any circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The approach from the northward to the northern entrance to
Iloilo is generally made by the coasting craft through the small,
richly wooded islands Gigantes, Sicogon, Pan de Azucar, Apiton,
&amp;c., called collectively the Silanga, which lie off the north-east
coast of Panay, and afford an admirable refuge for a considerable
distance to the vessels engaged in the trade with Manila and the
southernmost Bisangas. Though, however, there is excellent anchorage
among these islands, particularly at Pan de Azucar and Tagal, it would
be most prudent for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423"
name="pb423">423</a>]</span>large ships, in cases where there is no
practical acquaintance with the set of the tides, currents, &amp;c., to
take the outside channel between the Silanga and the island of
Negros.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After passing the Calabazos rocks and Papitas shoal, and
sighting the block-house of Banate&rdquo; (erected, like many others
along the Philippine coasts, for defence against the pirates of the
Sulu Sea), &ldquo;the course is due south, until sighting a group of
seven remarkable rocks, called the Seven Sins, which lie between the
north end of Guimaras and the Panay shore; a direct course for them
should then be made, taking care to keep the lead going to avoid the
Iguana Bank. Vessels of proper draught may enter the creek, or, if too
large, should bring up on the east side of the fort, where they are
protected from the wind and strength of the tide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lighthouse, for exhibiting a fixed light, is to be erected
on the Seven Sins, and another on Dumangas Point. Buoys are also to be
laid down along the channel near the Iguana and Oton
shoals.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14906src" href="#xd21e14906"

<p>Iloilo has great facilities for the introduction of wharves, piers
and landing-places, but none have been constructed. The entrance to the
river, and, indeed, the whole of its course, might be easily dredged,
hut little or nothing is done for the removal of the accumulating mud.

Vessels bound to Iloilo by the southern passage, if in the N.E.
monsoon, should, when to the northward of Point Guinad, beat up along
the coast of Guimaras. In April, 1859, in the barque <i>Camilla</i>,
from Manila to Iloilo, I had soundings much farther to the S.W. than
are laid down on the Spanish charts. With Point Guinad bearing south,
and Point Balingasag bearing east, I had from seven to nine fathoms
water, with soft ground. Stood to the N.W., had regular soundings seven
fathoms.</p>
<p class="footnote">When five or six miles off shore, had four fathoms,
tacked inshore, and brought up for the night, Point Cabalig bearing
N.E. two miles, eight fathoms water; good holding-ground, soundings
deepening to twenty fathoms when one mile off shore.</p>
<p class="footnote">Point Cabalig and Point Bondulan, when bearing
N.E., form two very prominent headlands, which are not shown on the
Spanish charts I had. With common precaution there is no danger
whatever in approaching the port of Iloilo by keeping the coast of
Guimaras close inboard from Point Cabalig until nearly abreast the
fort, which will clear the Oton Bank. Even should a vessel ground, she
will receive no damage, and can be easily got off, as the bottom is
quite soft. When the fort bears S.W. by W. one mile, the channel to
Iloilo is then open, and with a flood-tide keep the N.E. point close on
board. When past it, keep more over to the other shore, where there are
from three and a half to three fathoms water close to the shore, and
two fathoms at low water. The port of Iloilo is a perfect dock formed
by nature. Vessels lay alongside the wharf, where there are two and a
half fathoms at high water, and two fathoms at low water, and every
facility for discharging and loading. I discharged 200 tons of ballast
and took in 300 tons of sugar within nine days. Labour and fresh
provisions are very moderate.</p>

<p>The province of Pangasinan consists principally of an extensive
plain, or, rather, of a very gradual descent from the mountains where
the Igorrote Indians dwell, and extending to those of Zambales. The
roads are generally good and have trees planted by their sides, and the
lands are rich and fruitful. Many rivers descend from the hills and are
used for the conveyance of timber, rattans, and other forest
productions. The Igorrotes collect gold in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>the
mountain streams, especially in the neighbourhood of Asingan. Large
herds of wild buffaloes, oxen, deer and pigs, are found on the hills,
but little attended to by the natives. The fertility of the lands will
give a crop of sugar and of rice in the same year. The coast and lakes
abound with fish, of which, as of salt, cocoa-nut oil and sugar, there
is a considerable exportation. Hides are tanned for the Manila market.
Ship-building is an important branch of industry, especially on the
Agno River. Multitudes of the women are employed in making straw hats,
cigar-cases and other articles, of the fibres of various vegetables,
some of great fineness and selling for high prices&mdash;a cigar-case
is sometimes valued at an ounce of gold. Mats, plain and ornamented,
are also manufactured for use and for sale. It is said that the Indian,
with no other instrument than his knife for all his domestic needs, and
his plough for his field labours, supplies himself with every object of
desire. Women are proud of having woven and embroidered the garments
worn by their husbands and their children, and they present a gay
appearance on days of festivity. In the year 1755 there was a serious
insurrection against Spanish rule, and again in the year 1762, when the
English took Manila; but both were subdued, though the population was
diminished to the extent of 20,000 by these outbreaks. Two distinct
idioms are spoken in the province, the aboriginal Pangasinan people
being distinct from the races which penetrated from Ilocos. The
Dominican friars exercise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href=
"#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span>the principal ecclesiastical
authority in the province.</p>
<p>On our leaving Iloilo, after three days&rsquo; steaming, and
sighting Nasog and the Isla Verde, which had been recommended to us as
a preferable course to that of the outer passage by which we had come
down, we returned to Manila again to enjoy the hospitalities of the
palace of the Governor and the attentions of my friend Colonel
Trasierra, in whose hands I had been so kindly placed. We arrived on
the <i lang="es">Dia de los Reyes</i> (day of the kings), one of formal
reception at court. In the evening we took a long ride into the country
as far as the province of Bulacan, which is divided from that of Tondo
by a handsome stone bridge over a branch of the Pampanga River. The
question of going by land to Lingayen, which can in favourable
circumstances be accomplished in a day, the distance being thirty
leagues, was discussed, but the state of the roads not being
satisfactory, and the delay consequently uncertain, I determined again
to take ship, and on the second day of our voyage we anchored at Sual.
The captain of the port came out to pilot us into the harbour, in the
middle of which is a dangerous rock not laid down in many of the
charts. The narrowness of the passage requires much precaution, but
once anchored, it is a very safe and well-sheltered, though small
harbour. The appearance of Sual disappointed us; a few scattered
dwellings, the church and the custom-house, did not look very
promising. On landing, however, the musicians of the pueblo came to
escort <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>us with their band, and we learnt that all the
authorities were at Lingayen, a few miles off; but a courier was
immediately despatched to announce our arrival, and, as a specimen of
the language, I give a copy of the receipt he brought back to show that
his mission had been properly fulfilled:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="es" class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Recibido del Conductor de S. Idro (San Isidro)
alioncio (&aacute; las once?) Castilio so sagay agangan c&aacute;
Sogenti amar som pal ed Se&ntilde;or Aldi (Alcalde) ma&igrave;or sin

pitcha 11 de Eniro de 1859.</p>
<p class="signed">&rdquo;<span class="sc">Juan
Gabril.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Meaning, that having started at eight o&rsquo;clock from San Isidro,
the despatch was delivered at eleven o&rsquo;clock to the alcalde.</p>
<p>Carriages having been provided for our conveyance to the seat of
government (Lingayen), we started at early day for the convent at San
Isidro, which is on the left bank of the Agno, a fine river, affording
great facilities for navigation, and presenting charming points of
scenery on its banks, with the beauties of which we amused ourselves
until preparations for a procession were seen, and the sound of music
was heard from the opposite shore; upon which we embarked, and found
our Indian escorts, with comfortable carriages and sprightly horses,
and their accustomed display, waiting to receive us, the roads and
houses adorned as usual, and everything bearing marks of gaiety and
good-will. Tropical fruit-trees are seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb429" href="#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span>all along the line of
the road, through which the Indian cabanas prettily peep; the women and
children in their gay dress giving a picturesque and varied character
to the scene. The windows and platforms before the houses were crowded
with spectators, who seemed greatly delighted as from time to time we
recognized their courtesies or admired some flag more demonstrative or
more decorated than the rest. We entered one or two of the
ship-building yards, and our naval officials expressed their
satisfaction with the state of naval architecture among the natives.
One vessel on the stocks was of 350 tons. An Indian ship-builder, who
was introduced to us as being remarkable for mechanical genius, came
from some distance to ask permission from Captain Vansittart to visit
the <i>Magicienne</i>, and to instruct himself in matters connected
with the application of steam-engines to navigation, and to discover
any other improvements of which he expected a British ship of war to
bear about the evidence. The leave, which was very humbly asked, was
very courteously given; on obtaining which the Indian was trotted off
in his carriage without losing a moment. The abundance, adjacency,
excellence and cheapness of the materials on the banks of the Agno give
it great advantages for the construction of vessels, but the bar is a
great obstacle against their getting to sea.</p>
<p>We were met on the road by the alcalde mayor, and I entered his
carriage. The superior Spanish officials carry a cane with a gold head
and a silk <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430</a>]</span>tassel as a mark of their authority; and we
galloped away to Lingayen, the cabazera of the province. It has a
population of 23,000 souls. The roads were good, except in one part
where the Agno had made itself a new channel, and there the horses had
some difficulty in dragging the carriage through the sand. We came upon
the coast, and the waves were dashing with foaming impetuosity, as if
tempest-vexed, upon the shore; but joining again the principal
causeway, we pursued our journey without interruption. We had been
accompanied by the excellent Vice-Consul Don Jos&eacute; de Bosch and
Friar Gabriel, who was everywhere our guardian and guide. The
vice-consul was thoroughly cognizant of all commercial matters, and
furnished me with the information I sought. The friar was delighted to
pour out his stores of local knowledge, and they were great, while the
alcalde, Se&ntilde;or Combas, was in all things kind, considerate and
communicative. In fact, it was impossible not to feel at home when
everybody was contributing to amuse, interest and instruct. We visited
several of the pueblos in the neighbourhood, and at Calasiao, which has
18,000 inhabitants, the gobernadorcillo brought us specimens of the
manufactures of the place, and pressed a fine straw hat on my
acceptance, while the good Friar Gabriel insisted on every one of our
party carrying away a cigar-case. What we had seen elsewhere was
repeated in the pueblos through which we passed, in each of which the
friars and the principalia were on the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i>, not
only for our comfort <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431"
name="pb431">431</a>]</span>and accommodation, but to do us all honour.
We returned to Lingayen at sunset, and the good father summoned us to
dine with him the following day, on which occasion he said he would do
his best to show us what his convent could produce. And certainly
nothing was wanting. The tables were crowded with numerous guests, and
covered with abundant supplies of substantial and decorative dishes. I
imagine the father must have drawn on all the resources of the
community, for the meats and drinks, the plate and the porcelain,
decanters and glasses, and all the paraphernalia of a handsome public
dinner, were there, and there was no small amount of fun and jollity,
the padre taking the lead.</p>
<p>Father Gabriel boasted of the immense capabilities of the river
Agno. It flows through a large portion of the province of Pangasinan,
and was navigable for a great distance in its wanderings. He sketched
its course upon paper, and pointed out the many pueblos which it
visited. The misfortune was, it had a terrible bar, and could not be
navigated from or into the sea. The river is certainly one of
considerable depth, and of great beauty, having its source in the
Cordillera of Caraballes in the province of Abra, amidst wild
mountains, and receiving, in its flowing course, many confluent
streams. Between San Isidro and Lingayen there was much ship-building
on its banks, and a busy Indian population. On the shores were fine
forest trees ready for the hand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432"
href="#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span>of the woodman, materials for
cordage, bamboos and canes, which are brought down by the wild tribes
of Igorrotes. It is said that much gold is found in the sand and mud of
the river. Many attempts have been made by the Spaniards, and
especially by the friars, to conquer, civilize and christianize the
wild tenants of the rough and craggy regions, but with little success.
Their numbers are increased by criminals escaping from justice, and who
seek and find refuge in the least accessible parts of Luzon.</p>
<p>Father Gabriel, who has greatly interested himself in developing the
commercial resources of Sual, which he called his &ldquo;port,&rdquo;
expressed a confident expectation that the establishment of foreign
trade and the visits of shipping for cargoes, would induce the natives
to bring down their produce and open the way to the influences of
improvement.</p>
<p>We found it necessary to prepare for our departure, but our good
friends had determined, as we had come by land, we should return by
water, and an aquatic procession, with flags and music, was put in
motion. The sky lowered, the rain fell in tropical torrents, and the
musicians and other actors and spectators dispersed; nothing
discouraged, however, after a delay of two hours, sunshine brought them
out again. The boats were put in requisition, the bands of music
reassembled, and we embarked on the river Agno. All went on pleasantly
and perfectly for an hour, when a drenching storm compelled me to leave
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name=
"pb433">433</a>]</span>open barge in which I was, and to seek the
shelter of one of the covered boats. Many of our companions were as
thoroughly wetted as if they had been dragged through the water, and we
reached San Isidro as if escaped from wreck. There we sought dry
garments, and the friars&rsquo; wardrobes were largely drawn on for our
comforts. Grotesque, indeed, were the figures and drapery of many, and
a humorous sketcher might have made excellent capital out of the
laughing groups. Some got carriages, some horses, and some
disappointment, to help us to Sual, where a handsome dinner was
provided at the custom-house by the vice-consul. The harbour-master
broke out into poetry in honour of the British flag, and <i>gloria</i>
and <i>Victoria</i> rhymed in to the delectation of the guests, and to
the echoes of the walls. Our captain was inspired, and harangued our
hospitable hosts in answer to the warm <i>brindis</i> of the company.
The Indians had been studying our national song, and for the first time
the noble air of &ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo; was heard in the
pueblo of Sual. It was late when we got on board the <i>Magicienne</i>,
but before our departure on the following day, the authorities, the
vice-consul and the friar, with many attendants, were on board to give
us a <i lang="es">despedida</i> as kind as our welcome had been
cordial. They brought various presents as souvenirs, and a lilliputian
midshipman, who had excited the interest and admiration of the
visitors, was specially summoned that he might receive a cigar-case
from the hands of Padre Gabriel. As soon as they left, our anchor was
raised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>and we steamed away from Pangasinan and the
Philippines. It would be strange, indeed, if we took not with us a
grateful memory of what we had seen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
